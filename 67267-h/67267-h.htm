THOMAS HEYWOOD.
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
“<span class="sc">If</span> I were to be consulted as to a reprint of our old English
dramatists,” says Charles Lamb, “I should advise to begin with the
collected plays of Heywood. He was a fellow actor and fellow dramatist
with Shakespeare. He possessed not the imagination of the latter, but
in all those qualities which gained for Shakespeare the attribute of
gentle, he was not inferior to him&mdash;generosity, courtesy, temperance
in the depths of passion; sweetness, in a word, and gentleness;
Christianism, and true hearty Anglicism of feelings, shaping that
Christianism, shine throughout his beautiful writings in a manner more
conspicuous than in those of Shakespeare; but only more conspicuous,
inasmuch as in Heywood these qualities are primary, in the other
subordinate to poetry.” In another note Lamb calls Heywood a “prose
Shakespeare.” Allowing for the exaggeration with which an enthusiastic
love for our then neglected minor dramatists charged the criticism of
Charles Lamb, this verdict is in many points a just one. Heywood,
while he lacks the poetry, philosophy, deep insight into nature, and
consummate art of Shakespeare&mdash;those qualities, in a word, which
render Shakespeare supreme among dramatic poets&mdash;has a sincerity, a
tenderness of pathos, and an instinctive perception of nobility, that
distinguish him among the playwrights of the seventeenth century. Like
Dekker, he wins our confidence and love. We keep a place in our
affection for his favourite characters; they speak to us across two
centuries with the voices of friends; while the far more brilliant
masterpieces of many contemporary dramatists stir only our aesthetic
admiration.<a href="#i.03b" id="i.03a">[3]</a>
</p>

<p>
Heywood, unlike many of his contemporaries, and in this respect
notably unlike Dekker, seems to have kept tolerably free from joint
composition. Of twenty-four plays, only two, <i>The Late Lancashire
Witches</i> and <i>Fortune by Land and Sea</i>, were produced by him in
collaboration, the former with Brome, and the latter with W. Rowley.
Of all the playwrights of that period he was the most prolific. In
1633 he owned to having “had either an entire hand or at least a main
finger” in two hundred and twenty dramas; and after that date others
were printed, which may perhaps be reckoned in augmentation of this
number. His literary fertility is proved by his <i>Nine Books of Various
History concerning Women</i>, a folio of 466 pages, which appeared in
1624 with this memorandum: “Opus excogitatum inchoatum, explicitum, et
typographo excusum inter septemdecem septimanas.” Kirkman, the
book-seller, in his advertisement to the reader at the end of the
second edition of his catalogue of plays, observes of Heywood that “he
was very laborious; for he not only acted almost every day, but also
obliged himself to write a sheet every day for several years
together.” Besides composing dramas, he delighted in the labour of
compilation, and had for some time on hand a Biographical Dictionary
of all the poets, from the most remote period of the world’s history
down to his own time. The loss of his MS. collections for this book is
greatly to be regretted, since there was no man of that century better
qualified by geniality and honesty of purpose for the task than the
old playwright, who put into the lips of Apuleius:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0">“Not only whatsoever’s mine,</p>
<p class="i0">But all true poets’ raptures are divine.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">
Even as it is, the few lines in Heywood’s <i>Hierarchy of Angels</i> on the
nicknames of the poets of his day are among the raciest scraps of
information which we possess about those dramatists. The miscellaneous
nature of Heywood’s literary labours justifies us in classing him,
together with Robert Greene, among the earliest professional
<i>littérateurs</i> of our language. His criticism is often quite as
valuable as his dramatic poetry. The whole of the running dialogue
between Apuleius and Midas in <i>Love’s Mistress</i>, for example, contains
a theory of the relation of poets to the public, while the prologues
to <i>A Challenge for Beauty</i> and <i>The Royal King and Loyal Subject</i> are
interesting as showing to what extent the dramatists of the
Elizabethan age pursued their art with conscious purpose and
comparison.
</p>

<p>
We may notice how careless, in common with many of his contemporaries,
Heywood was concerning the fate of his dramatic writings. Plays, and
comedies in particular, were written, not to be read and studied, but
to be acted. This we should never forget while passing judgment upon
the unequal work of the Elizabethan playwrights. In the Address to the
Reader, prefixed to the <i>English Traveller</i>, Heywood complains that
this tragi-comedy had been published without his consent, and
apologises for coming forward to father it before the world, adding,
not without a sly poke at Jonson and his school:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="letter">

<p>
“True it is that my plays are not exposed unto the world in volumes,
to bear the title of works (as others); one reason is, that many of
them by shifting and change of companies had been negligently lost;
others of them are still retained in the hands of some actors, who
think it against their peculiar profit to have them come in print; and
a third that it never was any great ambition in me to be in this kind
voluminously read.”
</p>

</div>

<p>
In the preface to the <i>Rape of Lucrece</i> he repeats his complaints
against the clandestine and unauthorised publication of his plays,
with this declaration of his own habit of dealing with them:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="letter">

<p>
“It hath been no custom in me of all other men (courteous readers) to
commit my plays to the press; the reason, though some may attribute to
my own insufficiency, I had rather subscribe, in that, to their severe
censure, than, by seeking to avoid the imputation of weakness, to
incur greater suspicion of honesty; for though some have used a double
sale of their labours, first to the stage, and after to the press; for
my own part I here proclaim myself ever faithful to the first, and
never guilty of the last.”
</p>

</div>

<p>
He then proceeds to show that the pirated editions of his plays in
mangled copies have forced him to right himself before the public by
superintending the issue of a certain number of his works. In the
prologue to <i>If you Know not Me, you Know Nobody</i>, the same apology is
reiterated in terms which throw a curious light upon the short-hand
reporters of plays for the press, employed by piratical booksellers to
the prejudice of authors and theatre managers:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i6">“Some by stenography drew</p>
<p class="i0">The plot; put it in print (scarce one word true):</p>
<p class="i0">And in that lameness it hath limped so long,</p>
<p class="i0">The author now to vindicate that wrong</p>
<p class="i0">Hath took the pains, upright upon its feet</p>
<p class="i0">To teach it walk, so please you sit, and see’t.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">
Of the twenty-three plays in Mr. Pearson’s collection, four&mdash;namely,
the two parts of <i>Edward IV.</i> and the two parts of <i>If you Know not
Me, you Know Nobody</i>&mdash;are histories of the old-fashioned sort, rudely
dramatised from English chronicles, and seasoned with comic and
pathetic episodes. Of the two series, <i>Edward IV.</i> has in it more of
Heywood’s special quality; the interlude of the Tanner of Tamworth and
the romance of Mistress Shore displaying his double power of dealing
with drollery and passion in the simplest and most natural style. In
truth, the second part of <i>Edward IV.</i>, which begins with a dull,
confused account of that king’s wars in France, becomes a romantic
drama on the legend of Jane Shore. This is chiefly remarkable for the
way in which Heywood sustains the character of Master Shore, who is
the very mirror of sound English middle-class Christianity. The erring
wife’s portrait is touched with striking, if somewhat sentimental,
appeals to natural sympathy. Both are excellent examples of the
dramatist’s homely art and honest humanity, though nothing can be
balder and more artless than the manner of their death together on the
stage. <i>If you Know not Me, you Know Nobody</i> is a chronicle of the
reign of Queen Elizabeth, including her early dangers and the late
glories of the defeat of the Armada. The whole series of scenes
breathes the strongest English patriotism and the most enthusiastic
Protestant feeling. It is a pity that, hastily and clumsily pieced
together, a drama so interesting in its matter should almost be
valueless as a work of art. It was published as a companion to S.
Rowley’s <i>When you See Me, you Know Me</i>, which has been reprinted by
Dr. Karl Elze.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Late Lancashire Witches</i> and the <i>Wise Woman of Hogsdon</i> are
comedies of English life, without that element of romantic interest
which Heywood usually added to the domestic drama. The plot of the
latter play turns upon the quackeries and impostures of a professed
fortune-teller; but to mention it in the same breath with Jonson’s
<i>Alchemist</i> would be ridiculous. The <i>Lancashire Witches</i>, though it
attempts, in one scene at least, to touch the deeper interest of
witchcraft, deals for the most part only with the vulgar and farcical
aspects of the subject. It has nothing in common with <i>The Witch of
Edmonton</i> or Middleton’s <i>Witch</i>. A household turned topsy-turvy, a
coursing-match spoiled, a farm-servant changed into a gelding, and a
bridegroom bewitched with a charmed codpiece-point upon his wedding
night, are among its insipid drolleries. In <i>Fortune by Land and Sea</i>,
<i>The English Traveller</i>, <i>The Fair Maid of the Exchange</i>, and both
parts of <i>The Fair Maid of the West</i>, Heywood displays to better
advantage his predilection for homespun stories, dealing chiefly with
the incidents of country life and the adventures of English captains
on the high seas. Pure comedy and pure tragedy were neither of them
suited to his genius. He required a subject in which the familiar
events of English domestic life might be contrasted with the romantic
episodes of sea-roving and of foreign travel. To interweave these
motives with the addition of pathos and sentiment, was just what he
could do successfully. No dramatist has painted more faithful <i>home</i>
pictures. None have thrown more natural light upon the pursuits of
English gentlemen in the first half of the seventeenth century. The
merit of all these five plays is considerable. It would have been
impossible even for Fletcher to realise a difficult scene with greater
ease and delicacy than are displayed in the interview between young
Geraldine and Wincott’s wife in <i>The English Traveller</i>. A pair of
lovers, who have been parted, meet again and renew their old vows in
the bedroom of the girl just made a wife. The calm strength and
honourable feeling displayed by this Paolo and his Francesca in their
perilous interview are the result of unsuspecting innocence and
sweetness. If the situation is almost unnatural and disagreeable, the
poet has contrived to invest it with the air of purity, reality,
sincerity, and health. <i>Fortune by Land and Sea</i> is richer in scenes
which reveal Heywood at his best. The opening of this play is one of
his most vigorous transcripts from contemporary English country life.
Frank Forrest, a daring and high-blooded youngster, evades his careful
father, and flies off to a neighbouring tavern, less for the sake of
drinking than in order to meet spirited companions. One of them picks
a quarrel with him about his respect for his old father, and the boy
is killed. The grief of old Forrest, the challenge given by the
brother to Frank’s murderer, the duel that ensues, and young Forrest’s
escape, are all set forth with photographic reality and force. Event
huddles upon event, and the whole proceeds with the simplicity of
truth. These scenes only form a prelude to the play, which, like most
of Heywood’s, contains a double plot; but at the same time they are
its salt. The <i>Fair Maid of the West</i>, a romantic drama in two parts,
sets forth the adventures of the Devonshire Captain Spencer and his
love Bess Bridges, who is introduced to us as the mistress of a
Plymouth inn. It may be said in passing, that few tavern-scenes in our
Elizabethan drama, not even those of Dekker, are better painted than
those which form the introduction to Act I. Battles with pirates,
slavery in Fez, and adventures in Florence form the staple of the
drama, which must have presented many attractions to an English
audience of the age of Stukeley, Sherley, and Drake. The <i>Fair Maid of
the Exchange</i> is another play belonging to what the Germans style <i>das
bürgerliche Drama</i>. To my mind its sentiment is sickly, and its
story, in spite of many beautiful passages, disagreeable. Phillis is
the Fair Maid; and the real hero of the piece is a cripple, who saves
her from a ruffianly assault, and who falls in love with her. She
returns his love; but Heywood had not the courage to develop this
situation. Therefore he makes the cripple plead the cause of another
suitor to the Fair Maid, who at the end of the play transfers her
affections with a levity and a complacency that would be offensive in
real life. The charm of this comedy consists in a certain air of
April-morning freshness; it has, moreover, one of Heywood’s most
exquisite songs, a lyric that deserves to rank with Dekker’s, and
which is made for music: “Ye little birds that sit and sing.”
</p>

<p>
The seven plays on English domestic subjects which I have now
enumerated, are all of them eclipsed in their own kind by Heywood’s
masterpiece, <i>A Woman Killed with Kindness</i>. Leaving that, the finest
bourgeois tragedy of our Elizabethan literature, for future comment,
we come to another group of Heywood’s plays, which may perhaps be best
described as romances. Of these, <i>The Four Prentices of London</i>, a
juvenile performance of the poet, is both the least interesting, and
by far the most extravagant. Guy, Eustace, Tancred, and Godfrey, the
four sons of the Duke of Boulogne, and at the same time ’prentices in
London shops, start off like Paladins, and win their laurels in the
first Crusade. Whether this absurd play was intended, like Fletcher’s
<i>Knight of the Burning Pestle</i>, for a parody of chivalrous romances,
or whether, as its dedication to “the Honest and High-spirited
’Prentices, the Readers” seems to imply, it was meant for a
hyperbolical compliment to the courage of London counter-jumpers, is
not a very important matter. The latter is the more probable
supposition. The plot is a tissue of sanguinary and sentimental
adventures, with a certain admixture of good-humoured sarcasm on the
London cits, that may have gratified their ’prentice-lads. The old
quarto has for frontispiece a curious woodcut of the four knightly
shop-boys. <i>The Royal King and Loyal Subject</i> is a drama with an ideal
intention. Pretending to be founded upon English history, it really
sets forth the contest of generosity between a monarch and one of his
great nobles. In the course of this play Heywood has used some of the
motives that add pathos to <i>Patient Grissil</i>; the King of England
exposes the Lord Marshal to a series of humiliations and studied
insults before, as a climax to the favour he intends to heap upon him,
he unites his own family and that of his subject by a triple bond of
marriage. The whole situation is better in conception than in
execution. I take it to be one of Heywood’s earlier dramatic essays.
<i>A Challenge for Beauty</i> tells the tale of a proud Portuguese Queen,
who thinks herself the fairest woman of the world, but who is brought
at the end of the play to admit that she is vanquished as much in
beauty by an English lady as her husband’s captains are surpassed in
courage and courtesy by English gentlemen. The most interesting
portion of the drama is subordinate to the subject which supplies the
title. The contest of generosity between a noble Spaniard, Valladaura,
and an English captain, Montferrers, who has been sold into slavery
together with a friend that he dearly loved, displays all that innate
gentleness and chivalry which Lamb recognized as the fairest of
Heywood’s characteristics. Valladaura finds his old enemy Montferrers
in the slave-market, pays down his price, and sets him free.
Montferrers cannot accept freedom while his friend remains a slave.
Valladaura buys them both, taking Montferrers with him to remain, an
honoured guest, in his own house. Now begins the duel of courtesy
between the two men. Valladaura loves a lady, Petrocella, and
beseeches the Englishman to plead his suit with her. Montferrers
executes the task, though he also loves Petrocella, and discovers in
the course of his wooing that she returns his passion. The use he
makes of her avowal is to bind her over to accept the Spaniard’s suit.
But Valladaura is no whit less chivalrous. He resigns the lady to the
man who has deserved her best. Those who have not studied the working
out of such strained situations in the <i>Lustspiele</i> of Heywood or of
Fletcher, can hardly imagine what flesh and blood reality these poets
gave to almost inconceivable improbabilities. The vigorous and natural
play of passions under strange disguises and painful conditions&mdash;the
hesitations of divided allegiance&mdash;confusions of sex&mdash;contradictory
emotions, pleased our play-going ancestors; and the dramatists had the
skill to display the truth of human nature beneath the mask and garb
of romantic fantasies. Under other hands, or in an age of less
directness, such motives would have been ridiculous or offensive. <i>A
Maidenhead well Lost</i>, is a romance of this type with Italian
characters. While challenging comparison with similar comedies by
Fletcher, Ford, Massinger, and others, it is but a tasteless and
feeble production. Heywood was so thorough an Englishman that, for the
full exercise of his poetic faculty, he needed a subject smacking of
his native soil.
</p>

<p>
Having now described Heywood’s Histories, Domestic Dramas, and
Romances, it remains for me to speak of the fourth group into which
his plays may be divided. At the same time, I should observe that
these divisions are, after all, but incomplete and artificial. Many of
those which I have classified as Domestic Dramas, for example, borrow
largely from the element of romance, while two of them are virtually
comedies of farcical intrigue. The <i>Golden</i>, <i>Silver</i>, <i>Brazen</i>, and
<i>Iron Ages</i> form a series of four plays, in which Heywood has
dramatised antique legends, following principally Homer and Ovid in
the selection of his material. Though there are many passages of
graceful poetry and of humorous burlesque in these long-winded
mythologies, they cannot be said to have much value either as dramas
or as descriptive poems. That Heywood felt a natural predilection for
this kind of composition may be seen in the rhyming versions he has
made of Lucian’s Dialogues. Some of these, especially the
conversations of Jupiter with Ganymede, and of Juno with Jupiter,
deserve attention for their plain, straightforward rendering into racy
English of the witty Greek. <i>Love’s Mistress</i>, which is a dramatic
translation of Apuleius’s tale of Cupid and Psyche, is written in the
same mood. It takes the form of a long allegorical masque; and here
the poetry is sustained throughout at a higher level. Last of all
these classic dramas in my list comes the <i>Rape of Lucrece</i>. Here
Heywood quits the epical or allegorical treatment of classical
subject-matter for the domain of tragedy. Yet he has given to this
episode of ancient Roman history more the form of a chronicle-play
than of the legitimate drama.
</p>

<p>
It cannot be denied that the effects of negligence in composition and
over-strained fertility are traceable in all that Heywood wrote. He
has produced no masterpiece, no thoroughly sustained flight of fancy,
no play perfect in form, and very few absolutely self-consistent
characters. His finest passages seem to flow from him by accident, as
the result of a temporary exaltation of his talent, rather than of
settled purpose. His best scenes are improvised. Nor is it possible to
evade the conclusion, quaintly phrased by Kirkman, that “many of his
plays being composed loosely in taverns, occasions them to be so
mean.” These defects, indeed, Heywood shared in common with his
contemporaries. Not many dramatic compositions of the seventeenth
century can boast of classical finish or of artistic unity. Yet there
is in the best works of such men as Marlowe, Webster, Ford, and
Fletcher, a natural completeness, an unstudied singleness of effect,
which Heywood almost invariably misses. With all our affection for
him, we are forced to admire his poetry in fragments and with
reservations. Perhaps he shows to best advantage in the extracts made
by Lamb.
</p>

<p>
No dramatist ever used less artifice. The subjects which he chose are
either taken straight from real life, or else adopted crudely from the
legends of ancient Greece and Rome. In each case Heywood’s manner and
method are the same. He uses simple, easy English, and sets forth
unaffected feeling. The scenes have no elaborate connexion. They
cohere by juxtaposition. The language is never high-flown or
bombastic; rarely rising to the height of poetical diction, and
attaining to intensity only when the passion of the moment is
overwhelming, it owes its occasional force to its sincerity.
</p>

<p>
His means of reaching the heart are of the simplest; yet they are
often deep and effectual. He depends for his tragic effects upon no
Até, no midnight horrors, no sarcastic knave. Yet his use of some
mere name&mdash;<i>Nan, Nan!</i>&mdash;and his allusions to Christ and our religion,
go straight to the very soul. His men are all gentlemen; and it may be
said in passing that he had more understanding of men, especially
high-spirited young men, than of women. Nothing could be finer than
the bearing, for example, of young Forrest when he challenges
Rainsford, or of Valladaura and Montferrers, or again of Frankford and
Sir Charles Mountford in <i>A Woman Killed with Kindness</i>. Now and then
he touches the spring of true poetic language, as in these phrases:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i6">“Oh, speak no more!</p>
<p class="i0">For more than this I know and have recorded</p>
<p class="i0">Within the red-leaved table of my heart.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">
Or again:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i6">“My friend and I</p>
<p class="i0">Like two chain bullets side by side will fly</p>
<p class="i0">Thorough the jaws of death.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">
Or yet again:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i8">“Astonishment,</p>
<p class="i0">Fear, and amazement beat upon my heart,</p>
<p class="i0">Even as a madman beats upon a drum.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">
The last line of this quotation is a splendid instance of the way in
which the old dramatists heightened horror by connecting one terrific
image with another of a different sort, yet no less terrible. The fury
of a lunatic hideously rattling his drum with fantastic gestures
rushes across our mind without distracting our attention from the
anguish of the man who speaks the words. The simile does but add force
to his bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
Though not a lyrist in any high sense of the word, Heywood at times
produced songs remarkable for purity and freshness. To one of these in
the <i>Fair Maid of the Exchange</i> I have already called attention. Not
less beautiful is a morning ditty, which begins “Pack, clouds away,”
in the <i>Rape of Lucrece</i>. The patriotic war-song in the First Part of
<i>King Edward IV.</i>, “Agincourt, Agincourt, know ye not Agincourt?” is
full of fire; while a humorous catch, “The Spaniard loves his ancient
slop,” must have been a favourite with the groundlings, since it
occurs in both <i>The Rape of Lucrece</i> and <i>A Challenge for Beauty</i>.
There is plenty of proof that Heywood could write good words for
street melodies. That his English style is generally free, flowing,
and vernacular admits of no question; yet such were the contradictions
of the age in which he lived, that he must needs at intervals display
his erudition by the pedantic coinage of new phrases. Such words as
“trifurk,” to “diapason,” “sonance,” “cathedral state,” “tenebrous,”
“mœchal,” “monomachy,” “obdure” for “obdurate,” all of which occur in
<i>The Rape of Lucrece</i>, demand for their inventor the emetic which
Jonson in <i>The Poetaster</i> administered to Marston, and prove
conspicuously how a little learning on the lips of an honest
playwright is a dangerous thing.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Rape of Lucrece</i>, as I have before hinted, is nothing but the
narrative of Livy divided into tableaux with no artistic consistency.
It contains the whole story of Tullia’s ambition and the death of
Servius, the journey of Brutus to Delphi, the fulfilment of the
oracle, the betrayal of Gabii, the camp at Ardea, the crime of
Tarquin, the rising of the Roman nobles, the war with Porsena, and the
stories of Horatius and Scevola. The characters are devoid of personal
reality. Lucrece herself is more a type of innocence than a true
woman. Of the minor characters which fill out the play, by far the
most original is Valerius. His part must have been a favourite with
the London audience, for on the title-page we read: “with the several
songs in their apt places by Valerius, the merry lord among the Roman
peers.” Instead of fooling, sulking, or gaming, as the other nobles do
beneath the Tarquin tyranny, he does nothing but sing. It is
impossible to extract from him a word of sense in sober prose. But
love songs, loose songs, drinking songs, dirges, street cries, a
Scotch song, a Dutch song, and pastoral ditties, with rhymes on the
names of public houses, public women, ale, wine, and so forth, flow
from him in and out of season. He is the most striking instance of the
licence with which the poets of the time were forced to treat their
subjects for the sake of the gallery. Some of his verses are full of
exquisite feeling; others are grossly coarse; some are comical, and
others melancholy; but all are English. When Valerius first hears of
the outrage offered to Lucrece, he breaks out into a catch of the most
questionable kind, together with Horatius Cocles and a Clown. The
whole matter is turned to ridicule, and it is difficult after this
musical breakdown to read the tragedy except as a burlesque.
</p>

<p>
<i>Love’s Mistress</i> is a Masque in five acts rather than a play proper.
In its day it enjoyed great popularity, for it was represented before
James I. and his queen three times within the space of eight days. Its
three prologues and one epilogue are remarkable even among the
productions of that age for their fulsome flattery. The story of Cupid
and Psyche, on which the Masque is founded, could not have failed to
yield some beauties even to a far inferior craftsman than Heywood; and
there are many passages of delicate and tender poetry scattered up and
down the piece. Indeed, the whole is treated with an airy grace that
has peculiar charm, while its abrupt contrasts and frequent changes
must have made it a rare spectacle under the wise conduct of
</p>

<div class="letter">

<p class="noindent">
“that admirable artist, Mr. Inigo Jones, master-surveyor of the
king’s work, &amp;c., who to every act, nay, almost to every scene, by
his excellent inventions gave such an extraordinary lustre&mdash;upon
every occasion changing the stage, to the admiration of all the
spectators&mdash;that, as I must ingenuously confess, it was above my
apprehension to conceive.”
</p>

</div>

<p>
Still, even in <i>Love’s Mistress</i>, Heywood betrays that lack of the
highest artistic instinct, which we discover in almost all his work.
He cannot manage the Court pageant with that exquisite tact which
distinguishes the <i>Endimion</i> and the <i>Sapho</i> of Lyly. The whole play
has a running commentary of criticism and exposition, conveyed in a
dialogue between Apuleius, the author of the legend, and Midas, who
personates stupidity. Apuleius explains the allegory as the action
proceeds; Midas remains to the end the dull unappreciative boor, who
“stands for ignorance,” and only cares for dancing clowns, or the
coarse jests of buffoons. Apuleius is the type of the enthusiastic
poet, whose wit is “aimed at inscrutable things beyond the moon.”
Midas is the gross conceited groundling, who, turning everything he
touches to dross, prefers Pan’s fool to Apollo’s chorus, and drives
the god of light indignantly away. Both of them wear asses’ heads:
Midas, because he grovels on the earth; Apuleius, because all human
intellect proves foolish if it flies too far. There is much
good-humoured irony in this putting of donkey’s ears on the poet’s
head. This contrast between art and ignorance is paralleled by a
series of subtle antitheses that pervade the play. Immortal Erôs
finds a balance in the stupid clown, who boasts that Apollo has given
him music, Cupid love, and Psyche beauty; but who remains untunable,
unlovable, and hideous to the end. The juxtaposition of heaven and
hell within our souls, the aspirations and the downfalls of our
spirit, the nobility and the vileness of men around us, the perpetual
contradiction between the region toward which we soar in our best
moments, and the dull ground over which we have to plod in daily life:
such are the metaphysical conceptions which underlie the shifting
scenes and many-twinkling action of the masque. It would be unfair to
institute any comparison between <i>Love’s Mistress</i> considered as a
poem, and the delicate version of the legend in the <i>Earthly
Paradise</i>. Yet there are touches of true poetry here and there
throughout the play. The haunted house of Love which receives Psyche
and where Echo and Zephyrus are her attendants, the visit of her three
sisters, and the midnight awaking of wrathful Cupid, are all conceived
with light and airy fancy. Cupid in his anger utters this curse on
women:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0">“You shall be still rebellious, like the sea,</p>
<p class="i0">And, like the winds, inconstant; things forbid</p>
<p class="i0">You most shall covet, loathe what you would like</p>
<p class="i0">You shall be wise in wishes, but, enjoying,</p>
<p class="i0">Shall venture heaven’s loss for a little toying.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>
There is another aspect under which <i>Love’s Mistress</i> may be
viewed&mdash;as a very early attempt at classical burlesque. Cupid, for
example, is the naughty boy of Olympus. He describes Juno’s anger
against Ganymede:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0">“The boy by chance upon her fan had spilled</p>
<p class="i0">A cup of nectar: oh, how Juno swore!</p>
<p class="i0">I told my aunt I’d give her a new fan</p>
<p class="i0">To let Jove’s page be Cupid’s serving-man.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">
Vulcan appears at his forge with more orders than he knows how to deal
with:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0">“There’s half a hundred thunder-bolts bespoke;</p>
<p class="i0">Neptune hath broke his mace; and Juno’s coach</p>
<p class="i0">Must be new-mended, and the hindmost wheels</p>
<p class="i0">Must have two spokes set in.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">
He thinks of making Venus “turn she-smith,” but
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i9">“She’d spend me more</p>
<p class="i0">In nectar and sweet balls to scour her cheeks,</p>
<p class="i0">Smudged and besmeared with coal-dust and with smoke,</p>
<p class="i0">Than all her work would come to.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">
This is, of course, very simple fooling. Yet it contains the germ of
those more thorough-going parodies in which the present age delights.
</p>

<p>
The play in which Heywood showed for once that he was not unable to
produce a masterpiece is <i>A Woman Killed with Kindness</i>. All his
powers of direct painting from the English life he knew so well, his
faculty for lifting prose to the border-ground of poetry by the
intensity of the emotion which he communicates, his simple art of
laying bare the very nerves of passion, are here exhibited in
perfection. This domestic tragedy touches one like truth. Its scenes
are of everyday life. Common talk is used, and the pathos is homely;
not like Webster’s, brought from far. Tastes may differ as to the
morality or the wholesomeness of the sentiment evolved in the last
act. None, however, can resist its artless claim upon our sympathies.
The story may be briefly told. Mr. Frankford, a country gentleman of
good fortune, marries the sister of Sir Francis Acton, and receives
into his house an agreeable gentleman of broken means called Wendoll.
They live together happily till Wendoll, trusted to the full by
Frankford, takes advantage of his absence to seduce his wife.
Nicholas, a servant, who, with the instinct of a faithful dog, has
always suspected the stranger, discovers and informs Frankford of his
dishonour. Frankford obtains ocular proof of his wife’s guilt, and
punishes her by sending her to live alone, but at ease, in a manor
that belongs to him. There she pines away and dies at last, after a
reconciliation with her injured husband.<a href="#i.04b" id="i.04a">[4]</a>
</p>

<p>
In the <i>genre</i> Heywood had predecessors, but none of his rivals
surpassed him. The chief interest of the play centres in the pure,
confiding, tender-hearted character of Frankford. His blithe
contentment during the first months of marriage, and the generosity
with which he opens his doors to Wendoll, form a touching prelude to
the suspicions, indignantly repelled at first, which grow upon him
after he has weighed the tale of his wife’s infidelity related by
Nicholas. He resolves to learn the truth, if possible, by actual
experience. Here is interposed an admirable scene, in which Frankford
and his wife, with Wendoll and another gentleman, play cards. The
dialogue is a long <i>double entendre</i>, skilfully revealing the tortures
of a jealous husband’s mind and his suspicious misinterpretation of
each casual word. When they rise from the card-table, Frankford
instructs Nicholas to get him duplicate keys for all his rooms. Then
he causes a message to be delivered to him on a dark and stormy
evening, and sets off with his servant, intending to return at
midnight unnoticed and unexpected. His hesitation on the threshold of
his wife’s chamber is one of the finest turning-points of the dramatic
action. At last he summons courage to enter, but returns
immediately:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0">“O me unhappy! I have found them lying</p>
<p class="i0">Close in each other’s arms and fast asleep.</p>
<p class="i0">But that I would not damn two precious souls,</p>
<p class="i0">Bought with my Saviour’s blood, and send them, laden</p>
<p class="i0">With all their scarlet sins upon their backs,</p>
<p class="i0">Unto a fearful judgment, their two lives</p>
<p class="i0">Had met upon my rapier.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">
Then, with a passionate stretching forth of his desire toward the
impossible, which reveals the whole depth of his tenderness, he
cries:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0">“O God! O God! that it were possible</p>
<p class="i0">To undo things done; to call back yesterday!</p>
<p class="i0">That Time could turn up his swift sandy glass,</p>
<p class="i0">To untell the days, and to redeem these hours!</p>
<p class="i0">Or that the sun</p>
<p class="i0">Could, rising from the west, draw his coach backward,</p>
<p class="i0">Take from the account of time so many minutes,</p>
<p class="i0">Till he had all these seasons called again,</p>
<p class="i0">Those minutes, and those actions done in them,</p>
<p class="i0">Even from her first offence; that I might take her</p>
<p class="i0">As spotless as an angel in my arms!</p>
<p class="i0">But oh! I talk of things impossible,</p>
<p class="i0">And cast beyond the moon. God give me patience!</p>
<p class="i0">For I will in and wake them.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">
The following scene, in which Frankford pleads with his guilty and
conscience-stricken wife, is full of pathos. Its passion is simple and
homefelt. Each question asked by Frankford is such as a wronged
husband has the right to ask. Each answer given by the wife is broken
in mere monosyllables more eloquent than protestation. We feel the
whole, because not a word is strained or far-fetched, because the
tenderness of Frankford is not merely sentimental, because he does not
rave or tear his passion to tatters; finally, because in the
profundity of his grief he still can call his wife by her pet name.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Frankford is no Guinevere, nor, again, like Alice in <i>Arden of
Feversham</i>, is she steeled and blinded by an overwhelming passion.
Heywood fails to realise her character completely, producing, as
elsewhere in his portraits of women, a weak and vacillating picture.
She changes quite suddenly from love for her newly-wedded lord to
light longing for Wendoll, and then back again to the remorse which
eats her life away. Wendoll is drawn more powerfully. We see the
combat in his soul between the sense of duty to his benefactor and the
love which invades him like an ocean, drowning all the landmarks he
had raised to warn him from the perilous ground. Adultery has been
three times treated by Heywood. In <i>The English Traveller</i> Mrs.
Wincott sins with the same limp and unexplained facility as Mrs.
Frankford. In <i>Edward IV.</i> Jane Shore is meant to raise the same
sentimental pity as Mrs. Frankford on her death-bed.
</p>

<p>
Thomas Heywood was a Lincolnshire man, presumably of good family,
though I cannot find that the Visitations of that county record any
pedigree of his name. No poet of his age showed a more intimate
acquaintance with the habits of country gentlemen, and none was more
imbued with the spirit of true gentleness. He was a Fellow of Peter
House, Cambridge, where he probably acquired that learning which sat
upon him so lightly. He began to write for the stage as early as 1596,
and in 1598 we find him engaged as an actor and a sharer in Henslowe’s
company. Little else is known about his life, and, though it is
certain that he lived to a ripe age, we are ignorant of the date of
his death. Like many authors of his period, he adopted a motto for his
works, to which he adhered, placing on his title-pages, <i>Aut prodesse
solent aut delectare</i>. We may still say, with truth, that what he has
written almost invariably succeeds in both these aims. His plays are
defiled with very few unpardonably coarse scenes, those to be found in
<i>A Royal King and Loyal Subject</i> being an exception to prove the rule.
While concluding these introductory remarks, I can only express my
regret that the editor has not been able to include more pieces of
Heywood in the Mermaid Series; for Heywood is essentially an author
whom we love the better the more we read of him. It is impossible to
rise from the perusal of his plays without being refreshed and
invigorated. May the five here presented, out of the twenty-four which
bear his name, induce students to carry their researches further. They
will, I feel confident, discover that three other sets of five plays
are no less worthy of perusal than the five here chosen for their
recreation.

THE RED BULL THEATRE.
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">Heywood’s Plays</span> were frequently acted on the stage of the Red Bull
Theatre, of which Kirkman supplied an illustration in his collection
of <i>Drolls and Farces</i>. This illustration has been reproduced as a
frontispiece to the present volume. The theatre was one of the oldest
in London; originally it was, as the name indicates, an inn yard,
converted into a regular theatre during Elizabeth’s reign, and, like
several contemporary playhouses, often used for other amusements; it
was never considered a high-class theatre, but it was very popular.
Its site was on a plot of ground, between the upper end of St. John
Street and Clerkenwell Green, during the eighteenth century still
called Red Bull Yard, and named Woodbridge Street at the beginning of
the present century. In 1819 a writer who carefully investigated the
matter could find no trace of the theatre; though he indicated a field
of search by suggesting that its exact position might perhaps be set
forth in existing leases.
</p>

<p>
Various companies played at the Red Bull at different times. In 1623
the Queen’s company (under the jurisdiction of the “now Earl of
Leicester, then Lord Chamberlain of the Household of the said late
Queen Anne of Denmark”) gave place to the Prince’s, so called after
Prince Charles. In 1629, women actors (who also appeared at other
theatres) played at the Red Bull. In 1639 the Red Bull Company got
into trouble. A complaint was made to the king “that the stage-players
of the Red Bull have lately, for many days together, acted a
scandalous and libellous play, wherein they have audaciously
reproached, and in a libellous manner traduced and personated, not
only some of the Aldermen of the City of London and other persons of
quality, but also scandalised and defamed the whole profession of
Proctors belonging to the Court of Civil Law, and reflected upon the
Government.” For this they received “exemplary punishment.” In the
following year the company which had been playing at the Fortune
Theatre changed to the Red Bull.
</p>

<p>
This was the only theatre that lived on until Restoration times,
though not without many difficulties. Such items of information as the
following (1655) are not uncommon:&mdash;“At the playhouse this week many
were put to the rout by the soldiers.” “The actors, too,” Kirkman
writes, “were commonly not only stripped, but many times imprisoned,
till they paid such ransom as the soldiers should impose upon them.”
Although the Red Bull survived the Commonwealth it succumbed soon
after the Restoration. In 1660 Charles II. issued an order (not very
rigorously carried out) for their suppression, as a concession to
civic authorities. In 1661 Pepys wrote that “the clothes are very
poor, and the actors but common fellows.” Better and more modern
theatres arose, and in 1663 Davenant declared that “the Red Bull
stands empty for fencers: there are no tenants in it but spiders.”

<h2 id="ch1">
A WOMAN KILLED WITH<br/>
KINDNESS.
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">From</span> two entries in Henslowe’s Diary the date when <i>A Woman Killed
with Kindness</i> was written can be fixed with remarkable certainty. One
entry runs:&mdash;“Paid, at the appointment of the Company, the 6th of
March, 1603, unto Thomas Heywood, in full payment for his play, called
<i>A Woman Killed with Kindness</i>, the sum of ... £3;” and the
other&mdash;“Paid, at the appointment of Thomas Blackwood, the 7th of
March, 1603, unto the tailor which made the black satin suit for the
<i>Woman Killed with Kindness</i> the sum of ... 10<i>s</i>.” The earliest
printed notice of the piece occurs in Middleton’s <i>The Blacke Booke</i>,
1604, where it is coupled with the <i>Merry Devil of Edmonton</i>:&mdash;“And
being set out of the shop, ... she, by thy instructions, shall turn
the honest simple fellow off at the next turning, and give him leave
to see the <i>Merry Devil of Edmonton</i>, or <i>A Woman Killed with
Kindness</i>, when his mistress is going herself to the same murder.” In
1607 the play was published, and a third edition appeared in 1617. It
may be worth while to note that the title of the piece was a
proverbial expression: compare, for instance, <i>The Taming of the
Shrew</i> (to which Professor Dowden assigns the date 1597), iv. 1.
221:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0">“This is a way to kill a wife with kindness.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">
Professor Ward (<i>English Dramatic Literature</i>, ii. 114) refers also to
Fletcher’s <i>The Woman’s Prize</i>, iii. 4:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i11">“Some few,</p>
<p class="i0">For those are rarest, they are said to kill,</p>
<p class="i0">With kindness and fair usage.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>
An interesting point in the history of this drama is the fact that it
was quite recently revived by the Society of Dramatic Students, and
revived, I believe, with signal success. Perhaps the only weak element
in the five acts is the readiness with which the wife falls. I may add
that the division of the play into acts and scenes is here attempted
for the first time, at least in any edition of the piece.

<p class="i1">Was given you in the church I’ll borrow: sound!</p>
<p class="i1">This marriage music hoists me from the ground.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sir Charles Mountford.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Master Frankford,</p>
<p class="i1">You are a happy man, sir; and much joy</p>
<p class="i1">Succeed your marriage mirth! you have a wife</p>
<p class="i1">So qualified, and with such ornaments</p>
<p class="i1">Both of the mind and body. First, her birth</p>
<p class="i1">Is noble, and her education such</p>
<p class="i1">As might become the daughter of a prince:</p>
<p class="i1">Her own tongue speaks all tongues, and her own hand</p>
<p class="i1">Can teach all strings to speak in their best grace,</p>
<p class="i1">From the shrillest treble to the hoarsest base.</p>
<p class="i1">To end her many praises in one word,</p>
<p class="i1">She’s beauty and perfection’s eldest daughter,</p>
<p class="i1">Only found by yours, though many a heart hath sought her.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Frankford.</span></p>
<p class="i1">But that I know your virtues and chaste thoughts,</p>

<p class="i1">Nor flatters he that gives to her her due.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Mistress Frankford.</span></p>
<p class="i1">I would your praise could find a fitter theme</p>
<p class="i1">Than my imperfect beauties to speak on:</p>
<p class="i1">Such as they be, if they my husband please,</p>
<p class="i1">They suffice me now I am marrièd:</p>
<p class="i1">His sweet content is like a flattering glass,</p>
<p class="i1">To make my face seem fairer to mine eye;</p>
<p class="i1">But the least wrinkle from his stormy brow</p>
<p class="i1">Will blast the roses in my cheeks that grow.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sir Francis Acton.</span></p>
<p class="i1">A perfect wife already, meek and patient:</p>
<p class="i1">How strangely the word “husband” fits your mouth,</p>
<p class="i1">Not married three hours since! Sister, ’tis good;</p>
<p class="i1">You, that begin betimes thus, must needs prove</p>
<p class="i1">Pliant and duteous in your husband’s love.&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">Gramercies, brother, wrought her to’t already;</p>
<p class="i1">Sweet husband, and a curtsey, the first day!</p>
<p class="i1">Mark this, mark this, you that are bachelors,</p>
<p class="i1">And never took the grace of honest man;</p>
<p class="i1">Mark this, against you marry, this one phrase:</p>
<p class="i1">“In a good time that man both wins and woos,</p>
<p class="i1">That takes his wife down in her wedding shoes.”<a href="#fn1.02b" id="fn1.02a">[2]</a></p>

<p class="i1">Your sister takes not after you, Sir Francis;</p>
<p class="i1">All his wild blood your father spent on you:</p>
<p class="i1">He got her in his age, when he grew civil:</p>
<p class="i1">All his mad tricks were to his land entailed,</p>
<p class="i1">And you are heir to all; your sister, she</p>

<p class="i1">This morning, which to many seems a burden</p>
<p class="i1">Too heavy to bear, is unto you a pleasure.</p>
<p class="i1">This lady is no clog, as many are:</p>
<p class="i1">She doth become you like a well-made suit,</p>
<p class="i1">In which the tailor hath used all his art;</p>
<p class="i1">Not like a thick coat of unseasoned frieze,</p>
<p class="i1">Forced on your back in summer. She’s no chain</p>
<p class="i1">To tie your neck, and curb you to the yoke;</p>
<p class="i1">But she’s a chain of gold to adorn your neck.</p>
<p class="i1">You both adorn each other, and your hands,</p>
<p class="i1">Methinks, are matches: there’s equality</p>
<p class="i1">In this fair combination; you are both</p>
<p class="i1">Scholars, both young, both being descended nobly.</p>
<p class="i1">There’s music in this sympathy; it carries</p>
<p class="i1">Consort, and expectation of much joy,</p>
<p class="i1">Which God bestow on you, from this first day</p>
<p class="i1">Until your dissolution; that’s for aye.</p>

</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Susan.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Brother, why have you tricked me like a bride,</p>
<p class="i1">Bought me this gay attire, these ornaments?</p>
<p class="i1">Forget you our estate, our poverty?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sir Charles Mountford.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Call me not brother, but imagine me</p>
<p class="i1">Some barbarous outlaw, or uncivil kern;<a href="#fn1.41b" id="fn1.41a">[41]</a></p>
<p class="i1">For if thou shutt’st thy eye, and only hearest</p>
<p class="i1">The words that I shall utter, thou shalt judge me</p>
<p class="i1">Some staring ruffian, not thy brother Charles.</p>
<p class="i1">O sister!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Susan.</span></p>
<p class="i1">O brother, what doth this strange language mean?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sir Charles Mountford.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Dost love me, sister? wouldst thou see me live</p>
<p class="i1">A bankrupt beggar in the world’s disgrace,</p>
<p class="i1">And die indebted to my enemies?</p>
<p class="i1">Wouldst thou behold me stand like a huge beam</p>
<p class="i1">In the world’s eye, a bye-word and a scorn?</p>
<p class="i1">It lies in thee of these to acquit me free,</p>
<p class="i1">And all my debt I may out-strip by thee.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Susan.</span></p>
<p class="i1">By me! why, I have nothing, nothing left;</p>
<p class="i1">I owe even for the clothes upon my back;</p>
<p class="i1">I am not worth&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sir Charles Mountford.</span></p>
<p class="i1">O sister, say not so;</p>
<p class="i1">It lies in you my downcast state to raise,</p>
<p class="i1">To make me stand on even points with the world.</p>
<p class="i1">Come, sister, you are rich; indeed you are;</p>
<p class="i1">And in your power you have, without delay,</p>
<p class="i1">Acton’s five hundred pound back to repay.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Susan.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Till now I had thought you had loved me. By my honour</p>
<p class="i1">(Which I have kept as spotless as the moon),</p>
<p class="i1">I ne’er was mistress of that single doit</p>
<p class="i1">Which I reserved not to supply your wants;</p>
<p class="i1">And do you think that I would hoard from you?</p>
<p class="i1">Now, by my hopes in Heaven, knew I the means</p>
<p class="i1">To buy you from the slavery of your debts</p>
<p class="i1">(Especially from Acton, whom I hate),</p>
<p class="i1">I would redeem it with my life or blood.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sir Charles Mountford.</span></p>
<p class="i1">I challenge it; and, kindred set apart,</p>
<p class="i1">Thus, ruffian-like, I lay siege to your heart.</p>
<p class="i1">What do I owe to Acton?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Susan.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Why some five hundred pounds; towards which, I swear,</p>
<p class="i1">In all the world I have not one denier.<a href="#fn1.42b" id="fn1.42a">[42]</a></p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sir Charles Mountford.</span></p>
<p class="i1">It will not prove so. Sister, now resolve<a href="#fn1.43b" id="fn1.43a">[43]</a> me:</p>
<p class="i1">What do you think (and speak your conscience)</p>
<p class="i1">Would Acton give, might he enjoy your bed?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Susan.</span></p>
<p class="i1">He would not shrink to spend a thousand pound,</p>
<p class="i1">To give the Mountfords’ name so deep a wound.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sir Charles Mountford.</span></p>
<p class="i1">A thousand pound! I but five hundred owe;</p>
<p class="i1">Grant him your bed, he’s paid with interest so.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Susan.</span></p>
<p class="i1">O brother!</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sir Charles Mountford.</span></p>
<p class="i1">O sister! only this one way,</p>
<p class="i1">With that rich jewel you my debts may pay.</p>
<p class="i1">In speaking this my cold heart shakes with shame;</p>
<p class="i1">Nor do I woo you in a brother’s name,</p>
<p class="i1">But in a stranger’s. Shall I die in debt</p>
<p class="i1">To Acton, my grand foe, and you still wear</p>
<p class="i1">The precious jewel that he holds so dear?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Susan.</span></p>
<p class="i1">My honour I esteem as dear and precious</p>
<p class="i1">As my redemption.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sir Charles Mountford.</span></p>
<p class="i1">I esteem you, sister,</p>
<p class="i1">As dear, for so dear prizing it.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Susan.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Will Charles</p>
<p class="i1">Have me cut off my hands, and send them Acton?</p>
<p class="i1">Rip up my breast, and with my bleeding heart</p>
<p class="i1">Present him as a token?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sir Charles Mountford.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Neither, sister:</p>
<p class="i1">But hear me in my strange assertion.</p>
<p class="i1">Thy honour and my soul are equal in my regard;</p>
<p class="i1">Nor will thy brother Charles survive thy shame.</p>
<p class="i1">His kindness, like a burthen hath surcharged me,</p>
<p class="i1">And under his good deeds I stooping go,</p>
<p class="i1">Not with an upright soul. Had I remained</p>
<p class="i1">In prison still, there doubtless I had died:</p>
<p class="i1">Then, unto him that freed me from that prison,</p>
<p class="i1">Still do I owe this life. What moved my foe</p>
<p class="i1">To enfranchise me? ’Twas, sister, for your love.</p>
<p class="i1">With full five hundred pounds he bought your love,</p>
<p class="i1">And shall he not enjoy it? Shall the weight</p>
<p class="i1">Of all this heavy burthen lean on me,</p>
<p class="i1">And will not you bear part? You did partake</p>
<p class="i1">The joy of my release; will you not stand</p>
<p class="i1">In joint-bond bound to satisfy the debt?</p>
<p class="i1">Shall I be only charged?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Susan.</span></p>
<p class="i1">But that I know</p>
<p class="i1">These arguments come from an honoured mind,</p>
<p class="i1">As in your most extremity of need</p>
<p class="i1">Scorning to stand in debt to one you hate,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">Nay, rather would engage your unstained honour</p>
<p class="i1">Than to be held ingrate,&mdash;I should condemn you.</p>
<p class="i1">I see your resolution, and assent;</p>
<p class="i1">So Charles will have me, and I am content.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sir Charles Mountford.</span></p>
<p class="i1">For this I tricked you up.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Susan.</span></p>
<p class="i1">But here’s a knife,</p>
<p class="i1">To save mine honour, shall slice out my life.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sir Charles Mountford.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Ay! know thou pleasest me a thousand times</p>
<p class="i1">More in that resolution than thy grant.&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">Observe her love; to soothe it to my suit,</p>
<p class="i1">Her honour she will hazard, though not lose:</p>
<p class="i1">To bring me out of debt, her rigorous hand</p>
<p class="i1">Will pierce her heart. O wonder! that will choose,</p>
<p class="i1">Rather than stain her blood, her life to lose.&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">Come, you sad sister to a woful brother,</p>
<p class="i1">This is the gate: I’ll bear him such a present,</p>
<p class="i1">Such an acquittance for the knight to seal,</p>
<p class="i1">As will amaze his senses, and surprise</p>
<p class="i1">With admiration all his fantasies.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Susan.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Before his unchaste thoughts shall seize on me,</p>
<p class="i1">’Tis here shall my imprisoned soul set free.</p>

<p class="i1">Lo! for thy more assurance, here’s a pawn,&mdash;</p>

<p class="i1">Me, all his store; whom howsoe’er you prize</p>
<p class="i1">As forfeit to your hand, he values highly,</p>

THE FAIR MAID OF<br/>
THE WEST.<br/>
<i><span class="sc">Part I</span></i>.
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
<i>The Fair Maid of the West, or a Girl worth Gold</i>, “as it was
lately acted before the king and queen with approved liking,” was
first published (both parts) in 1631: it had been acted as early as
1617, and from the title-page we may conclude that it held the stage
for some time. It probably represents the dramatisation of some
already-existent story-book or ballad. “We should be sorry,”
remarks Mr. Saintsbury,<a href="#fn2.01b" id="fn2.01a">[1]</a> “to lose <i>The Fair Maid of the
West</i>, with its picture of Devonshire sailors, foreign merchants,
kings of Fez, bashaws of various parts, Italian dukes, and what not.
The two parts make anything but a good play, but they are decidedly
interesting.” Only the first has here been given, as it is
complete in itself, and the second part is of less value.
</p>

<p>
I have marked the changes of scene, and in one or two places have
made trifling corrections in the text. For instance, in scene iv. of
the first act, by reading “your hopes deceased,” and changing
the punctuation, we get a very fair sense where Collier (who edited
the play for the Shakespeare Society) was inclined to think that a
line had dropped out.

<p class="center">
To the much worthy and my most respected<br/>
<span class="sc">John Othow</span>, Esquire,<br/>
Counsellor at Law, in the noble Society of Gray’s Inn.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Excuse</span> this my boldness, I entreat you, and let it pass under the
title of my love and respect, long devoted unto you; of which, if I
endeavour to present the world with a due acknowledgement, without
the sordid expectation of reward or servile imputation of flattery,
I hope it will be the rather accepted. I must ingenuously
acknowledge, a weightier argument would have better suited with your
grave employment; but there are retirements necessarily belonging to
all the labours of the body and brain. If in any such cessation you
will deign to cast an eye upon this weak and unpolished poem, I
shall receive it as a courtesy from you, much exceeding any merit in
me, my good meaning only excepted. Thus wishing you healthful
ability in body, untroubled content in mind, with the happy fruition
of both the temporal felicities of the world present, and the
eternal blessedness of the life future, I still remain as ever,
</p>

<p class="sign2">
Yours, most affectionately devoted,<br/>

<h3>
To the <span class="sc">Reader</span>.

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">Courteous</span> Reader, my plays have not been exposed to the public
view of the world in numerous sheets and a large volume, but singly,
as thou seest, with great modesty and small noise. These comedies,
bearing the title of <i>The Fair Maid of the West</i>, if they prove but
as gracious in thy private reading as they were plausible in the
public acting, I shall not much doubt of their success. Nor need
they, I hope, much fear a rugged and censorious brow from thee, on
whom the greatest and best in the kingdom have vouchsafed to smile.
I hold it no necessity to trouble thee with the argument of the
story, the matter itself lying so plainly before thee in acts and
scenes, without any deviations or winding indents.

<p class="i0">The queens and ladies argued at that time</p>

<p class="i1">The great success at Cales,<a href="#fn2.07b" id="fn2.07a">[7]</a> under the conduct</p>
<p class="i1">Of such a noble general, hath put heart</p>

<p class="i1">How Plymouth swells with gallants; how the streets</p>

<p class="i1">Why so, I prithee?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Clem.</span></p>

eighteenpence.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Spencer.</span></p>
<p class="d1">To imagine that in the same instant that one forfeits all his
estate, another enters upon a rich possession. As one goes to the
church to be married, another is hurried to the gallows to be
hanged; the last having no feeling of the first man’s joy, nor the
first of the last man’s misery. At the same time that one lies
tortured upon the rack, another lies tumbling with his mistress over
head and ears in down and feathers. This when I truly consider, I
cannot but wonder why any fortune should make a man ecstasied.</p>

THE<br/>
ENGLISH TRAVELLER.
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
<i>The English Traveller</i> was first printed in 1633, and from the
preface it would seem that the publication of the play was an
accident; the date of its production (at the Cockpit in Drury Lane)
we do not know. The bye-plot of the prodigal Lionel and his servant
is borrowed from Plautus’ <i>Mostellaria</i>, which a century or more
later was laid under contribution by Fielding in his <i>Intriguing
Chambermaid</i>. Heywood may have known Plautus’ comedy in the original
or in one of the Italian versions. The character of Young Geraldine
deserves study: “he is,” says Professor Ward, “one of the truest
gentlemen of Elizabethan comedy.” Mr. Saintsbury (<i>Elizabethan
Literature</i>, p. 284) ranks <i>The English Traveller</i> with <i>A Woman
Killed with Kindness</i> as Heywood’s best plays.

SIR HENRY APPLETON, <span class="sc">Knight Baronet, etc.</span>

<p class="noindent">
Noble Sir,
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">For</span> many reasons I am induced to present this Poem to your
favourable acceptance; and not the least of them that alternate love
and those frequent courtesies which interchangeably passed betwixt
yourself and that good old gentleman, mine uncle (Master Edmund
Heywood), whom you pleased to grace by the title of father. I must
confess I had altogether slept (my weakliness and bashfulness
discouraging me) had they not been wakened and animated by that
worthy gentleman your friend and my countryman, Sir William Elvish,
whom (who for his unmerited love many ways extended towards me,) I
much honour; neither, sir, need you to think it any undervaluing of
your worth to undertake the patronage of a poem in this nature,
since the like hath been done by Roman Lælius, Scipio, Mæcenas,
and many other mighty princes and captains; nay, even by Augustus
Cæsar himself, concerning whom Ovid is thus read (<i>De Tristi</i>, lib.
2):
</p>

<p class="i0">Majestas adeo comis ubique tua est.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
So highly were they respected in the most flourishing estate of the
Roman Empire; and if they have been vilified of late by any
separistical humorist (as in the now questioned
<i>Histrio-Mastix</i>),<a href="#fn3.01b" id="fn3.01a">[1]</a> I hope by the next term (Minerva
assistente) to give such satisfaction to the world, by vindicating
many particulars in that work maliciously exploded and condemned, as
that no gentleman of quality and judgment but shall therein receive
a reasonable satisfaction. I am loth by tediousness to grow
troublesome, therefore conclude with a grateful remembrance of my
service, intermixed with myriads of zealous wishes for your health
of body and peace of mind, with superabundance of earth’s
blessings and Heaven’s graces, ever remaining,

<h3>
TO THE READER.
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">If</span>, Reader, thou hast of this play been an auditor, there is less
apology to be used by entreating thy patience. This tragi-comedy
(being one reserved amongst two hundred and twenty in which I have
had either an entire hand, or at the least a main finger) coming
accidentally to the press, and I having intelligence thereof,
thought it not fit that it should pass as <i>filius populi</i>, a bastard
without a father to acknowledge it. True it is, that my plays are
not exposed unto the world in volumes, to bear the title of works,
(as others); one reason is, that many of them by shifting and change
of companies have been negligently lost; others of them are still
retained in the hands of some actors, who think it against their
peculiar profit to have them come in print; and a third, that it
never was any great ambition in me, to be in this kind voluminously
read. All that I have further to say at this time is only this:
censure<a href="#fn3.02b" id="fn3.02a">[2]</a> I entreat as favourably as it is exposed to thy view
freely. Ever

<p class="i1">Gentlemen, welcome; but what need I use</p>
<p class="i1">A word so common, unto such to whom</p>
<p class="i1">My house was never private? I expect</p>
<p class="i1">You should not look for such a needless phrase,</p>
<p class="i1">Especially you, Master Geraldine;</p>
<p class="i1">Your father is my neighbour, and I know you</p>
<p class="i1">Even from the cradle; then I loved your infancy,</p>
<p class="i1">And since your riper growth bettered by travel:</p>
<p class="i1">My wife and you in youth were play-fellows,</p>
<p class="i1">And must not now be strangers; as I take it,</p>
<p class="i1">Not above two years different in your age.</p>

<p class="i1">So much he hath outstripped me.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wincott.</span></p>
<p class="i1">I would have you</p>
<p class="i1">Think this your home, free as your father’s house,</p>
<p class="i1">And to command it, as the master on’t;</p>
<p class="i1">Call boldly here, and entertain your friends,</p>
<p class="i1">As in your own possessions: when I see’t,</p>
<p class="i1">I’ll say you love me truly, not till then;</p>
<p class="i1">Oh, what a happiness your father hath,</p>
<p class="i1">Far above me!&mdash;one to inherit after him,</p>
<p class="i1">Where I (Heaven knows) am childless.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">That defect</p>
<p class="i1">Heaven hath supplied in this your virtuous wife,</p>
<p class="i1">Both fair, and full of all accomplishments;</p>
<p class="i1">My father is a widower, and herein</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wife.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Oh, Master Geraldine,</p>
<p class="i1">Flattery in men’s an adjunct of their sex,</p>
<p class="i1">This country breeds it, and for that, so far</p>
<p class="i1">You needed not to have travelled.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Truth’s a word</p>
<p class="i1">That should in every language relish well,</p>
<p class="i1">Nor have I that exceeded.</p>

<p class="i1">Sir, my husband</p>
<p class="i1">Hath took much pleasure in your strange discourse</p>

<p class="i1">How the new city differs from the old,</p>
<p class="i1">What ruins of the Temple yet remain,</p>
<p class="i1">And whether Sion, and those hills about,</p>
<p class="i1">With the adjacent towns and villages,</p>
<p class="i1">Keep that proportioned distance as we read;</p>
<p class="i1">And then in Rome, of that great pyramis</p>
<p class="i1">Reared in the front, on four lions mounted;</p>
<p class="i1">How many of those idol temples stand,</p>
<p class="i1">First dedicated to their heathen gods,</p>
<p class="i1">Which ruined, which to better use repaired;</p>
<p class="i1">Of their Pantheon, and their Capitol,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">What structures are demolished, what remain.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wincott.</span></p>
<p class="i1">And what more pleasure to an old man’s ear,</p>
<p class="i1">That never drew save his own country’s air,</p>
<p class="i1">Than hear such things related? I do exceed him</p>
<p class="i1">In years, I must confess, yet he much older</p>
<p class="i1">Than I in his experience.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Prudentilla.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Master Geraldine,</p>
<p class="i1">May I be bold to ask you but one question,</p>
<p class="i1">The which I’d be resolved in?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Geraldine.</span></p>

<p class="i1">That lies within my knowledge.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wincott.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Put him to’t.</p>
<p class="i1">Do, sister, you shall find him, make no doubt,</p>
<p class="i1">Most pregnant in his answer.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Prudentilla.</span></p>
<p class="i1">In your travels</p>
<p class="i1">Through France, through Savoy, and through Italy,</p>
<p class="i1">Spain, and the Empire, Greece and Palestine,</p>
<p class="i1">Which breeds the choicest beauties?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">In troth, lady,</p>
<p class="i1">I never cast on any in those parts</p>
<p class="i1">A curious eye of censure,<a href="#fn3.03b" id="fn3.03a">[3]</a> since my travel</p>
<p class="i1">Was only aimed at language, and to know;</p>
<p class="i1">These passed me but as common objects did&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">Seen, but not much regarded.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Prudentilla.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Oh, you strive</p>
<p class="i1">To express a most unheard-of modesty,</p>
<p class="i1">And seldom found in any traveller,</p>
<p class="i1">Especially of our country, thereby seeking</p>
<p class="i1">To make yourself peculiar.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">I should be loth</p>
<p class="i1">Profess in outward show to be one man,</p>
<p class="i1">And prove myself another.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Prudentilla.</span></p>
<p class="i1">One thing more:</p>
<p class="i1">Were you to marry, you that know these climes,</p>
<p class="i1">Their states and their conditions, out of which</p>
<p class="i1">Of all these countries would you choose your wife?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">I’ll answer you in brief: as I observe,</p>
<p class="i1">Each several clime, for object, fare, or use,</p>
<p class="i1">Affords within itself for all of these</p>
<p class="i1">What is most pleasing to the man there born:</p>
<p class="i1">Spain, that yields scant of food, affords the nation</p>
<p class="i1">A parsimonious stomach, where<a href="#fn3.04b" id="fn3.04a">[4]</a> our appetites</p>
<p class="i1">Are not content but with the large excess</p>
<p class="i1">Of a full table; where the pleasing’st fruits</p>
<p class="i1">Are found most frequent, there they best content;</p>
<p class="i1">Where plenty flows, it asks abundant feasts;</p>
<p class="i1">For so hath provident Nature dealt with all.</p>
<p class="i1">So in the choice of women: the Greek wantons,</p>
<p class="i1">Compelled beneath the Turkish slavery,</p>
<p class="i1">Vassal themselves to all men, and such best</p>
<p class="i1">Please the voluptuous that delight in change;</p>
<p class="i1">The French is of one humour, Spain another,</p>
<p class="i1">The hot Italian has a strain from both,</p>
<p class="i1">All pleased with their own nations&mdash;even the Moor,</p>
<p class="i1">He thinks the blackest the most beautiful;</p>
<p class="i1">And, lady, since you so far tax my choice,</p>
<p class="i1">I’ll thus resolve you: being an Englishman,</p>
<p class="i1">’Mongst all these nations I have seen or tried,</p>
<p class="i1">To please me best, here would I choose my bride.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Prudentilla.</span></p>
<p class="i1">And happy were that lady, in my thoughts,</p>
<p class="i1">Whom you would deign that grace to.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wife.</span></p>
<p class="i1">How now, sister!</p>
<p class="i1">This is a fashion that’s but late come up.</p>
<p class="i1">For maids to court their husbands.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wincott.</span></p>
<p class="i1">I would, wife,</p>
<p class="i1">It were no worse, upon condition</p>
<p class="i1">They had my helping hand and purse to boot,</p>
<p class="i1">With both in ample measure. Oh, this gentleman</p>
<p class="i1">I love, nay almost dote on.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wife.</span></p>
<p class="i1">You’ve my leave</p>
<p class="i1">To give it full expression.</p>

<p class="i1">In these arms, then.</p>
<p class="i1">Oh, had my youth been blest with such a son,</p>
<p class="i1">To have made my estate to my name hereditary,</p>
<p class="i1">I should have gone contented to my grave,</p>
<p class="i1">As to my bed; to death, as to my sleep;</p>
<p class="i1">But Heaven hath will in all things. Once more welcome;</p>

the kitchen’s in a heat, and the cook hath so bestirred himself
that he’s in a sweat. The jack<a href="#fn3.05b" id="fn3.05a">[5]</a> plays music, and the spits

found that’s ill: he that’s a good house-keeper keeps a good table,
a good table is never without good stools, good stools seldom
without good guests, good guests never without good cheer, good
cheer cannot be without good stomachs, good stomachs without good
digestion, good digestion keeps men in good health; and therefore,
all good people that bear good minds, as you love goodness, be sure
to keep good meat and drink in your houses, and so you shall be
called good men, and nothing can come on’t but good, I warrant you.

<p class="i1">Caviare, sturgeon, anchoves, pickle-oysters; yes,</p>
<p class="i1">And a potato pie; besides all these,</p>
<p class="i1">What thou think’st rare and costly.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Reignald.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Sir, I know</p>
<p class="i1">What’s to be done; the stock that must be spent</p>
<p class="i1">Is in my hands, and what I have to do</p>
<p class="i1">I will do suddenly.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Lionel.</span></p>
<p class="i1">No butcher’s meat;</p>
<p class="i1">Of that beware in any case.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Reignald.</span></p>
<p class="i1">I still remember</p>
<p class="i1">Your father was no grazier; if he were,</p>
<p class="i1">This were a way to eat up all his fields,</p>
<p class="i1">Hedges and all.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Lionel.</span></p>
<p class="i1">You will begone, sir?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Lionel.</span></p>
<p class="i1">To what may young men best compare themselves?</p>
<p class="i1">Better to what, than to a house new built,</p>
<p class="i1">The fabric strong, the chambers well contrived,</p>
<p class="i1">Polished within, without well beautified;</p>
<p class="i1">When all that gaze upon the edifice</p>
<p class="i1">Do not alone commend the workman’s craft,</p>
<p class="i1">But either make it their fair precedent</p>
<p class="i1">By which to build another, or at least</p>
<p class="i1">Wish there to inhabit? Being set to sale,</p>
<p class="i1">In comes a slothful tenant, with a family</p>
<p class="i1">As lazy and debauched; rough tempests rise,</p>
<p class="i1">Untile the roof, which by their idleness</p>
<p class="i1">Left unrepaired, the stormy showers beat in,</p>
<p class="i1">Rot the main posts and rafters, spoil the rooms,</p>
<p class="i1">Deface the ceilings, and in little space</p>
<p class="i1">Bring it to utter ruin, yet the fault</p>
<p class="i1">Not in the architector that first reared it,</p>
<p class="i1">But him that should repair it. So it fares</p>
<p class="i1">With us young men; we are those houses made;</p>
<p class="i1">Our parents raise these structures, the foundation</p>
<p class="i1">Laid in our infancy; and as we grow</p>
<p class="i1">In years, they strive to build us by degrees,</p>
<p class="i1">Story on story higher; up at height,</p>
<p class="i1">They cover us with counsel, to defend us</p>
<p class="i1">From storms without; they polish us within</p>
<p class="i1">With learnings, knowledge, arts and disciplines;</p>
<p class="i1">All that is naught and vicious they sweep from us,</p>
<p class="i1">Like dust and cobwebs, and our rooms concealed,</p>
<p class="i1">Hang with the costliest hangings, ’bout the walls</p>
<p class="i1">Emblems and beauteous symbols pictured round:</p>
<p class="i1">But when that lazy tenant, Love, steps in,</p>
<p class="i1">And in his train brings sloth and negligence,</p>
<p class="i1">Lust, disobedience, and profuse excess,</p>
<p class="i1">The thrift with which our fathers tiled our roofs</p>
<p class="i1">Submits to every storm and winter’s blast,</p>
<p class="i1">And, yielding place to every riotous sin,</p>
<p class="i1">Gives way without to ruin what’s within:</p>
<p class="i1">Such is the state I stand in.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Scapha.</span></p>
<p class="d1">I’ll tell thee, daughter: in that thou knowest thyself to be
beloved of so many, and settlest thy affection only upon one. Doth
the mill grind only when the wind sits in one corner, or ships only
sail when it’s in this or that quarter? Is he a cunning fencer that
lies but at one guard, or he a skilful musician that plays but on
one string? Is there but one way to the wood, and but one bucket
that belongs to the well? To affect one, and despise all other,
becomes the precise matron, not the prostitute; the loyal wife, not
the loose wanton. Such have I been as you are now, and should learn
to sail with all winds, defend all blows, make music with all
strings, know all the ways to the wood, and, like a good travelling
hackney, learn to drink of all waters.</p>

have done. Thou seest, here’s nothing but prodigality and pride,
wantoning and wasting, rioting and revelling, spoiling and spending,
gluttony and gormandising&mdash;all goes to havoc. And can this hold out?
When he hath nothing left to help himself, how can he harbour thee?
Look at length to drink from a dry bottle, and feed from an empty
knapsack; look to’t, ’twill come to that.</p>

</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wincott.</span></p>
<p class="i1">And what’s this Delavil?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wife.</span></p>
<p class="i1">My apprehension</p>
<p class="i1">Can give him no more true expression,</p>
<p class="i1">Than that he first appears a gentleman,</p>
<p class="i1">And well conditioned.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wincott.</span></p>
<p class="i1">That for outward show;</p>
<p class="i1">But what in him have you observèd else,</p>
<p class="i1">To make him better known?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wife.</span></p>
<p class="i1">I have not eyes</p>
<p class="i1">To search into the inward thoughts of men,</p>
<p class="i1">Nor ever was I studied in that art</p>
<p class="i1">To judge of men’s affection by the face;</p>
<p class="i1">But that which makes me best opinioned of him</p>
<p class="i1">Is that he’s the companion and the friend</p>
<p class="i1">Beloved of him whom you so much commend&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">The noble Master Geraldine.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wincott.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Thou hast spoke</p>
<p class="i1">That which not only crowns his true desert,</p>
<p class="i1">But now instates him in my better thoughts,</p>
<p class="i1">Making his worth unquestioned.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wife.</span></p>
<p class="i1">He pretends</p>
<p class="i1">Love to my sister Pru. I have observed him</p>
<p class="i1">Single her out to private conference.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wincott.</span></p>
<p class="i1">But I could rather, for her own sake, wish</p>
<p class="i1">Young Geraldine would fix his thoughts that way,</p>
<p class="i1">And she towards him; in such affinity,</p>
<p class="i1">Trust me, I would not use a sparing hand.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wife.</span></p>
<p class="i1">But Love in these kinds should not be compelled,</p>
<p class="i1">Forced, nor persuaded; when it freely springs,</p>
<p class="i1">And of itself takes voluntary root,</p>
<p class="i1">It grows, it spreads, it ripens, and brings forth</p>
<p class="i1">Such an usurious crop of timely fruit</p>
<p class="i1">As crowns a plenteous autumn.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wincott.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Such a harvest</p>
<p class="i1">I should not be the ungladdest man to see, [<i>Enter</i> Clown.</p>
<p class="i1">Of all thy sister’s friends.&mdash;Now, whence come you?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Clown.</span></p>
<p class="d1">Who, I, sir? from a lodging of largess, a house of hospitality, and
a palace of plenty; where there’s feeding like horses and drinking
like fishes; where for pints, we’re served in pottles; and instead
of pottle-pots, in pails; instead of silver tankards, we drink out
of water-tankards; claret runs as freely as the cocks, and canary
like the conduits of a coronation day; where there’s nothing but
feeding and frolicking, carving in kissing, drinking and dancing,
music and madding, fiddling and feasting.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wincott.</span></p>
<p class="d1">And where, I pray thee, are all these revels kept?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Clown.</span></p>
<p class="d1">They may be rather called reaks<a href="#fn3.11b" id="fn3.11a">[11]</a> than revels; as I came along
by the door I was called up amongst them&mdash;he-gallants and
she-gallants. I no sooner looked out, but saw them out with their
knives, slashing of shoulders, mangling of legs, and
lanching<a href="#fn3.12b" id="fn3.12a">[12]</a> of loins, till there was scarce a whole limb left
amongst them.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wincott.</span></p>
<p class="i1">A fearful massacre!</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Clown.</span></p>
<p class="d1">One was hacking to cut off a neck; this was mangling a breast; his
knife slipped from the shoulder, and only cut off a wing; one was
picking the brains out of a head, another was knuckle-deep in a
belly; one was groping for a liver, another searching for the
kidneys. I saw one pluck the soul<a href="#fn3.13b" id="fn3.13a">[13]</a> from the body&mdash;goose that
she was to suffer’t!; another pricked into the breast with his own
bill&mdash;woodcock to endure it!</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wife.</span></p>
<p class="i1">How fell they out at first?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Clown.</span></p>
<p class="d1">I know not that, but it seems one had a stomach, and another had a
stomach; but there was such biting and tearing with their teeths,
that I am sure I saw some of their poor carcasses pay for’t.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wincott.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Did they not send for surgeons?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Clown.</span></p>
<p class="d1">Alas, no! surgeons’ help was too late; there was no stitching up of
those wounds, where limb was plucked from limb; nor any salve for
those scars, which all the plaster of Paris cannot cure.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wincott.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Where grew the quarrel first?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Clown.</span></p>
<p class="d1">It seems it was first broached in the kitchen, certain creatures
being brought in thither by some of the house. The cook, being a
choleric fellow, did so towse them and toss them, so pluck them and
pull them, till he left them as naked as my nail; pinioned some of
them like felons; cut the spurs from others off their heels; then
down went his spits, some of them he ran in at the throat, and out
at the backside: about went his basting-ladle, where he did so
besauce them that many a shrewd<a href="#fn3.14b" id="fn3.14a">[14]</a> turn they had amongst them.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wife.</span></p>
<p class="i1">But, in all this, how did the women scape?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Clown.</span></p>
<p class="d1">They fared best, and did the least hurt that I saw, but for
quietness-sake were forced to swallow what is not yet digested; yet
every one had their share, and she that had least, I am sure, by
this time hath her bellyful.</p>

<p class="d1">Marry, sir, at your next neighbour’s, Young Master Lionel, where
there is nothing but drinking out of dry-vats, and healthing in
half-tubs; his guests are fed by the belly, and beggars served at
his gate in baskets. He’s the adamant of this age, the daffodil of
these days, the prince of prodigality, and the very Cæsar of all
young citizens.</p>

<p class="i1">Not as I apprehended?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Clown.</span></p>
<p class="d1">Your gravity hath guessed aright: the chiefest that fell in this
battle were wild fowl and tame fowl; pheasants were wounded instead
of alfarez,<a href="#fn3.15b" id="fn3.15a">[15]</a> and capons for captains; anchoves stood for
ancients, and caviare for corporals; dishes were assaulted instead
of ditches, and rabbits were cut to pieces upon the
rebellings;<a href="#fn3.16b" id="fn3.16a">[16]</a> some lost their legs, whilst other of their
wings were forced to fly; the pioner undermined nothing but pie
crust, and&mdash;</p>

<p class="i1">Enough, enough! your wit hath played too long</p>
<p class="i1">Upon our patience.&mdash;Wife, it grieves me much</p>
<p class="i1">Both for the young and old man: the one graces</p>
<p class="i1">His head with care, endures the parching heat</p>
<p class="i1">And biting cold, the terrors of the lands,</p>
<p class="i1">And fears at sea, in travel, only to gain</p>
<p class="i1">Some competent estate to leave his son;</p>
<p class="i1">Whiles all that merchandise, through gulfs, cross-tides,</p>
<p class="i1">Pirates, and storms, he brings so far, the other</p>
<p class="i1">Here shipwrecks in the harbour.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wife.</span></p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wincott.</span></p>
<p class="i1">An unthrift youth, his father now at sea.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Why, that’s the very subject upon which</p>
<p class="i1">It seems this jest is grounded; there this night</p>
<p class="i1">Was a great feast.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Clown.</span></p>

<p class="i1">In the height of their carousing, all their brains</p>
<p class="i1">Warmed with the heat of wine, discourse was offered</p>
<p class="i1">Of ships, and storms at sea;<a href="#fn3.19b" id="fn3.19a">[19]</a> when suddenly,</p>
<p class="i1">Out of his giddy wildness, one conceives</p>
<p class="i1">The room wherein they quaffed to be a pinnace,</p>
<p class="i1">Moving and floating; and the confused noise</p>
<p class="i1">To be the murmuring winds, gusts, mariners;</p>
<p class="i1">That their unsteadfast footing did proceed</p>
<p class="i1">From rocking of the vessel: this conceived,</p>
<p class="i1">Each one begins to apprehend the danger,</p>
<p class="i1">And to look out for safety. “Fly,” saith one,</p>
<p class="i1">“Up to the main-top, and discover;” he</p>
<p class="i1">Climbs by the bed-post to the tester, there</p>
<p class="i1">Reports a turbulent sea and tempest towards,</p>
<p class="i1">And wills them, if they’ll save their ship and lives,</p>
<p class="i1">To cast their lading overboard; at this</p>
<p class="i1">All fall to work, and hoist into the street,</p>
<p class="i1">As to the sea, what next come to their hand&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">Stools, tables, trestles, trenchers, bedsteads, cups,</p>
<p class="i1">Pots, plate, and glasses; here a fellow whistles,</p>
<p class="i1">They take him for the boatswain; one lies struggling</p>
<p class="i1">Upon the floor, as if he swum for life;</p>
<p class="i1">A third takes the bass-viol for the cockboat,</p>
<p class="i1">Sits in the belly on’t, labours and rows,</p>
<p class="i1">His oar the stick with which the fiddler played;</p>
<p class="i1">A fourth bestrides his fellows, thinking to scape</p>
<p class="i1">As did Arion on the dolphin’s back,</p>
<p class="i1">Still fumbling on a gittern.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Clown.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Excellent sport!</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wincott.</span></p>
<p class="i1">But what was the conclusion?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">The rude multitude,</p>
<p class="i1">Watching without, and gaping for the spoil</p>
<p class="i1">Cast from the windows, went by the ears about it;</p>
<p class="i1">The constable is called to atone<a href="#fn3.20b" id="fn3.20a">[20]</a> the broil,</p>
<p class="i1">Which done, and hearing such a noise within</p>
<p class="i1">Of imminent shipwreck, enters the house, and finds them</p>
<p class="i1">In this confusion. They adore his staff,</p>
<p class="i1">And think it Neptune’s trident, and that he</p>
<p class="i1">Comes with his Tritons (so they called his watch)</p>
<p class="i1">To calm the tempest, and appease the waves;</p>
<p class="i1">And at this point we left them.</p>

<p class="i1">Thanks, Master Geraldine, for this discourse;</p>
<p class="i1">In troth it hath much pleased me; but the night</p>

<p class="i1">We now are left alone.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wife.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Why, say we be, who should be jealous of us?</p>
<p class="i1">This is not first of many hundred nights</p>
<p class="i1">That we two have been private: from the first</p>
<p class="i1">Of our acquaintance, when our tongues but clipped</p>
<p class="i1">Our mother’s-tongue, and could not speak it plain,</p>
<p class="i1">We knew each other; as in stature, so</p>
<p class="i1">Increased our sweet society; since your travel,</p>
<p class="i1">And my late marriage, through my husband’s love,</p>
<p class="i1">Midnight hath been as mid-day, and my bed-chamber</p>
<p class="i1">As free to you as your own father’s house,</p>
<p class="i1">And you as welcome to’t.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">I must confess</p>
<p class="i1">It is in you your noble courtesy,</p>
<p class="i1">In him a more than common confidence,</p>
<p class="i1">And in this age can scarce find precedent.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wife.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Most true; it is withal an argument</p>
<p class="i1">That both our virtues are so deep impressed</p>
<p class="i1">In his good thoughts, he knows we cannot err.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">A villain were he to deceive such trust,</p>
<p class="i1">Or, were there one, a much worse character.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wife.</span></p>
<p class="i1">And she no less, whom either beauty, youth,</p>
<p class="i1">Time, place, or opportunity could tempt</p>
<p class="i1">To injure such a husband.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">You deserve,</p>
<p class="i1">Even for his sake, to be for ever young;</p>
<p class="i1">And he, for yours, to have his youth renewed,</p>
<p class="i1">So mutual is your true conjugal love;</p>
<p class="i1">Yet, had the Fates so pleased&mdash;</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wife.</span></p>
<p class="i1">I know your meaning.</p>
<p class="i1">It was once voiced that we two should have matched;</p>
<p class="i1">The world so thought, and many tongues so spake;</p>
<p class="i1">But Heaven hath now disposed us otherways;</p>
<p class="i1">And being as it is, (a thing in me</p>
<p class="i1">Which, I protest, was never wished nor sought),</p>
<p class="i1">Now done, I not repent it.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">In those times,</p>
<p class="i1">Of all the treasures of my hopes and love,</p>
<p class="i1">You were the exchequer, they were stored in you;</p>
<p class="i1">And, had not my unfortunate travel crossed them,</p>
<p class="i1">They had been here reserved still.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wife.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Troth, they had;</p>
<p class="i1">I should have been your trusty treasurer.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">However, let us love still, I entreat:</p>
<p class="i1">That, neighbourhood and breeding will allow;</p>
<p class="i1">So much the laws divine and human both</p>

<p class="i1">Heaven then forbid that they should limit us</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wife.</span></p>
<p class="i1">If they should not,</p>
<p class="i1">We might proclaim they were not charitable,</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Will you resolve me one thing?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wife.</span></p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">That’s the thing I crave,</p>
<p class="i1">And only that&mdash;to have a place next him.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wife.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Presume on that already; but perhaps</p>
<p class="i1">You mean to stretch it further.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Only thus far:</p>
<p class="i1">Your husband’s old, to whom my soul doth wish</p>
<p class="i1">A Nestor’s age, so much he merits from me;</p>
<p class="i1">Yet if (as proof and Nature daily teach</p>
<p class="i1">Men cannot always live, especially</p>
<p class="i1">Such as are old and crazed) he be called hence,</p>
<p class="i1">Fairly, in full maturity of time,</p>
<p class="i1">And we two be reserved to after-life,</p>
<p class="i1">Will you confer your widowhood on me?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wife.</span></p>
<p class="i1">You ask the thing I was about to beg;</p>
<p class="i1">Your tongue hath spake mine own thoughts.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Vow to that.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wife.</span></p>
<p class="i1">As I hope mercy.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">’Tis enough; that word</p>
<p class="i1">Alone instates me happy. Now, so please you,</p>
<p class="i1">We will divide, you to your private chamber,</p>
<p class="i1">I to find out my friend.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wife.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Nay, Master Geraldine,</p>
<p class="i1">One ceremony rests yet unperformed:</p>
<p class="i1">My vow is past, your oath must next proceed;</p>
<p class="i1">And as you covet to be sure of me,</p>
<p class="i1">Of you I would be certain.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Make ye doubt?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wife.</span></p>
<p class="i1">No doubt; but Love’s still jealous, and in that</p>
<p class="i1">To be excused; you then shall swear by Heaven,</p>
<p class="i1">And as in all your future acts you hope</p>
<p class="i1">To thrive and prosper; as the day may yield</p>
<p class="i1">Comfort, or the night rest; as you would keep</p>
<p class="i1">Entire the honour of your father’s house,</p>
<p class="i1">And free your name from scandal and reproach;</p>
<p class="i1">By all the goodness that you hope to enjoy,</p>
<p class="i1">Or ill to shun&mdash;</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">You charge me deeply, lady.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wife.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Till that day come, you shall reserve yourself</p>
<p class="i1">A single man; converse nor company</p>
<p class="i1">With any woman, contract nor combine</p>
<p class="i1">With maid or widow; which expected hour,</p>
<p class="i1">As I do wish not haste, so when it happens</p>
<p class="i1">It shall not come unwelcome. You hear all;</p>
<p class="i1">Vow this.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">By all that you have said, I swear,</p>
<p class="i1">And by this kiss confirm.</p>

<p class="i1">Forgot by chance to put the candle out:</p>

<p class="i1">So loud that I soon wakened, brought in light,</p>
<p class="i1">And found him almost drowned in fearful sweat;</p>
<p class="i1">Amazed to see’t, I did demand the cause,</p>

<p class="i1">Oh, proceed;</p>

<p class="i1">With gold and jewels to this fatal house,</p>
<p class="i1">Where, seeking safety, I encountered death:</p>
<p class="i1">The covetous merchant, landlord of this rent,</p>
<p class="i1">To whom I gave my life and wealth in charge,</p>
<p class="i1">Freely to enjoy the one, robbed me of both:</p>
<p class="i1">Here was my body buried, here my ghost</p>
<p class="i1">Must ever walk, till that have Christian right;</p>
<p class="i1">Till when, my habitation must be here.</p>
<p class="i1">Then fly, young man; remove thy family,</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Delavil.</span></p>
<p class="i1">True, sir, at best; but what when scandalous tongues</p>
<p class="i1">Will make the worst, and what’s good in itself,</p>
<p class="i1">Sully and stain by fabulous misreport?</p>
<p class="i1">For let men live as chary as they can,</p>
<p class="i1">Their lives are often questioned; then no wonder</p>
<p class="i1">If such as give occasion of suspicion</p>
<p class="i1">Be subject to this scandal. What I speak</p>

<p class="i1">To stop this clamour ere it grow too rank,</p>

<p class="d1">I shall, sir. This is market-day, and here acquaintance commonly
meet; and whom have I encountered? my gossip Pint-pot, and
brim-full; nay, I mean to drink with you before I part. And how doth
all your worshipful kindred? your sister Quart, your pater Pottle
(who was ever a gentleman’s fellow), and your old grandsire Gallon;
they cannot choose but be all in health, since so many healths have
been drunk out of them: I could wish them all here, and in no worse
state than I see you are in at this present. Howsoever, gossip,
since I have met you hand to hand, I’ll make bold to drink to
you&mdash;nay, either you must pledge me, or get one to do’t for you, Do
you open your mouth towards me? well, I know what you would say:
“Here, Roger, to your master and mistress, and all our good friends
at home. Gramercy, gossip, if I should not pledge thee, I were
worthy to be turned out to grass, and stand no more at livery.” And
now, in requital of this courtesy, I’ll begin one health to you and
all your society in the cellar&mdash;to Peter Pipe, Harry Hogshead,
Bartholomew Butt, and little Master Randal Rundlet, to Timothy
Taster, and all your other great and small friends.</p>

<p class="i1">Of all your more than many courtesies:</p>
<p class="i1">You’ve been my second father, and your wife</p>
<p class="i1">My noble and chaste mistress; all your servants</p>
<p class="i1">At my command; and this your bounteous table</p>

<p class="i1">What might then be</p>
<p class="i1">The cause of this constraint, in thus absenting</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Out of many,</p>
<p class="i1">I will propose some few: the care I have</p>
<p class="i1">Of your as yet unblemishèd renown,</p>
<p class="i1">The untouched honour of your virtuous wife,</p>
<p class="i1">And (which I value least, yet dearly too)</p>
<p class="i1">My own fair reputation.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wincott.</span></p>
<p class="i1">How can these</p>
<p class="i1">In any way be questioned?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Oh, dear sir,</p>
<p class="i1">Bad tongues have been too busy with us all;</p>
<p class="i1">Of which I never yet had time to think,</p>
<p class="i1">But with sad thoughts and griefs unspeakable.</p>
<p class="i1">It hath been whispered by some wicked ones,</p>

<p class="i1">By some that have maligned our happiness,</p>
<p class="i1">(Heaven, if it can brook slander, pardon them!)</p>
<p class="i1">That this my customary coming hither</p>
<p class="i1">Hath been to base and sordid purposes:</p>
<p class="i1">To wrong your bed, injure her chastity,</p>

<p class="i1">As Heaven is true, I know’t.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Now, this calumny</p>
<p class="i1">Arriving first unto my father’s ears,</p>
<p class="i1">His easy nature was induced to think</p>
<p class="i1">That these things might perhaps be possible:</p>
<p class="i1">I answered him as I would do to Heaven,</p>
<p class="i1">And cleared myself in his suspicious thoughts</p>
<p class="i1">As truly as the high all-knowing Judge</p>
<p class="i1">Shall of these stains acquit me, which are merely</p>
<p class="i1">Aspersions and untruths. The good old man,</p>
<p class="i1">Possessed with my sincerity, and yet careful</p>
<p class="i1">Of your renown, her honour, and my fame,</p>
<p class="i1">To stop the worst that scandal could inflict,</p>
<p class="i1">And to prevent false rumours, charges me,</p>
<p class="i1">The cause removed, to take away the effect;</p>
<p class="i1">Which only could be to forbear your house&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">And this upon his blessing. You hear all.</p>

<p class="i1">With which my love most cavilled, orators<a href="#fn3.44b" id="fn3.44a">[44]</a></p>
<p class="i1">In your behalf. Had such things passed betwixt you,</p>
<p class="i1">Not threats nor chidings could have driven you hence.</p>
<p class="i1">It pleads in your behalf, and speaks in hers,</p>
<p class="i1">And arms me with a double confidence,</p>
<p class="i1">Both of your friendship and her loyalty:</p>
<p class="i1">I am happy in you both, and only doubtful</p>
<p class="i1">Which of you two doth most impart my love.</p>
<p class="i1">You shall not hence to-night.</p>

<p class="i1">Brought me thus near, and I not visit her?</p>
<p class="i1">Should it arrive her ear, perhaps might breed</p>
<p class="i1">Our lasting separation; for, ’twixt lovers,</p>

old Master Geraldine, his son, and I cannot tell how many. But this

on your knees to your master.&mdash;Now, gentlemen, what do you say to
your inviting to my master’s feast?</p>

<p class="i1">We will attend him.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Old Lionel.</span></p>

<p class="i1">Nor, gentlemen, let not what’s hereto past,</p>
<p class="i1">In your least thoughts disable my estate:</p>
<p class="i1">This my last voyage hath made all things good,</p>
<p class="i1">With surplus too; be that your comfort, son.</p>
<p class="i1">Well, Reignald&mdash;&mdash;But no more.</p>

</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Old Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Son, let me tell you, you are ill advised,</p>
<p class="i1">And doubly to be blamed, by undertaking</p>
<p class="i1">Unnecessary travel, grounding no reason</p>
<p class="i1">For such a rash and giddy enterprise.</p>
<p class="i1">What profit aim you at, you have not reaped?</p>
<p class="i1">What novelty affords the Christian world,</p>
<p class="i1">Of which your view hath not participated</p>
<p class="i1">In a full measure? Can you either better</p>
<p class="i1">Your language or experience? Your self-will</p>
<p class="i1">Hath only purpose to deprive a father</p>
<p class="i1">Of a loved son, and many noble friends</p>
<p class="i1">Of your much-wished acquaintance.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Oh, dear sir,</p>
<p class="i1">Do not, I do entreat you, now repent you</p>
<p class="i1">Of your free grant, which with such care and study</p>
<p class="i1">I have so long, so often laboured for.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Old Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Say that may be dispensed with, show me reason</p>
<p class="i1">Why you desire to steal out of your country,</p>
<p class="i1">Like some malefactor that had forfeited</p>
<p class="i1">His life and freedom. Here’s a worthy gentleman</p>
<p class="i1">Hath for your sake invited many guests,</p>
<p class="i1">To his great charge, only to take of you</p>
<p class="i1">A parting leave: you send him word you cannot&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">After, you may not come. Had not my urgence,</p>
<p class="i1">Almost compulsion, driven you to his house,</p>
<p class="i1">The unkindness might have forfeited your love,</p>
<p class="i1">And razed you from his will; in which he hath given you</p>
<p class="i1">A fair and large estate; yet you of all this strangeness</p>
<p class="i1">Show no sufficient ground.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Then understand</p>
<p class="i1">The ground thereof took his first birth from you;</p>
<p class="i1">’Twas you first charged me to forbear the house,</p>
<p class="i1">And that upon your blessing. Let it not then</p>
<p class="i1">Offend you, sir, if I so great a charge</p>
<p class="i1">Have strived to keep so strictly.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Old Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Me perhaps</p>
<p class="i1">You may appease, and with small difficulty,</p>
<p class="i1">Because a father; but how satisfy</p>
<p class="i1">Their dear and, on your part, unmerited love?</p>
<p class="i1">But this your last obedience may salve all.</p>
<p class="i1">We now grow near the house.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Geraldine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Whose doors, to me,</p>
<p class="i1">Appear as horrid as the gates of Hell.</p>
<p class="i1">Where shall I borrow patience, or from whence,</p>
<p class="i1">To give a meeting to this viperous brood</p>
<p class="i1">Of friend and mistress?</p>

THE WISE-WOMAN OF<br/>
HOGSDON.
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
<i>The Wise-Woman of Hogsdon</i> was printed in 1638. Of its history
nothing is known; that it was popular is implied by the statement on
the title-page&mdash;“As it hath been sundry times acted with great
applause.” The technical cleverness of the last Act is noticeable.
In the original editions the play is divided into acts but not into
scenes. These are now indicated for the first time.
</p>

<p>
Hogsdon, <i>i.e.</i> Hoxton, in the parish of St. Leonard’s, Shoreditch,
was described by Stow, in 1598, as “a large street with houses on
both sides.” It was in the adjacent fields that the duel was fought
between Ben Jonson and Gabriel Spenser, a player belonging to
Henslowe’s company, which resulted in the death of the latter and
put Jonson in peril of his life.

<i>Enter, as newly come from play</i>, Young <span class="sc">Chartley, Sencer,
Boyster</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="sc">Haringfield</span>.
</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Chartley.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Price of my life! now, if the devil have bones,</p>
<p class="i1">These dice are made of his. Was ever such</p>
<p class="i1">A cast seen in this age? Could any gull</p>
<p class="i1">In Europe, saving myself, fling such a cast?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Boyster.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Ay.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Chartley.</span></p>
<p class="i1">No.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Boyster.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Yes.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Chartley.</span></p>
<p class="i1">But I say no: I have lost an hundred pound,</p>
<p class="i1">And I will have my saying.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Boyster.</span></p>
<p class="i1">I have lost another hundred, I’ll have mine.</p>
<p class="i1">Ay, yes, I flung a worse,&mdash;a worse by odds.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Chartley.</span></p>
<p class="i1">I cry you mercy, sir; losers may speak;</p>
<p class="i1">I’ll not except ’gainst you: but let me see</p>
<p class="i1">Which of these two that pocket up our cash</p>
<p class="i1">Dares contradict me?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sencer.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Sir, not I:</p>
<p class="i1">I say you have had bad casting.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Haringfield.</span></p>
<p class="i1">So say I.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Chartley.</span></p>
<p class="i1">I say this hat’s not made of wool:</p>
<p class="i1">Which of you all dares say the contrary?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sencer.</span></p>
<p class="i1">It may be ’tis a beaver.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Haringfield.</span></p>
<p class="d1">Very likely so: ’tis not wool, but a plain beaver.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Chartley.</span></p>
<p class="d1">’Tis wool, but which of you dares say so?&mdash;[<i>Aside</i>.] I would fain
pick a quarrel with them, to get some of my money again; but the
slaves now they have got it, are too wise to part with it. I say it
is not black.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Haringfield.</span></p>
<p class="i1">So say we too.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Boyster.</span></p>
<p class="d1">’Tis false: his cap’s of wool; ’tis black and wool, and wool and
black.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Chartley.</span></p>
<p class="d1">I have nought to say to losers. Have I nothing left to set at a
cast? Ay, finger, must you be set in gold, and not a jot of silver
in my purse? A bale<a href="#fn4.01b" id="fn4.01a">[1]</a> of fresh dice! Ho, come at this ring!</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sencer.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Fie, Master Chartley! ’tis time to give over.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Chartley.</span></p>
<p class="d1">That’s the winner’s phrase. Hold me play, or he that hath uncrowned
me, I’ll take a speedy order with him.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Boyster.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Fresh dice! This jewel I will venture more:</p>
<p class="i1">Take this and all. I’ll play in spite of luck.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Haringfield.</span></p>
<p class="d1">Since you will needs, trip for the dice. I see it is hard to go a
winner from this company.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Chartley.</span></p>
<p class="d1">The dice are mine. This diamond I value at twenty marks:<a href="#fn4.02b" id="fn4.02a">[2]</a>
I’ll venture it at a throw.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Haringfield.</span></p>
<p class="i1">’Tis set you.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Chartley.</span></p>
<p class="d1">Then at all. All’s mine. Nay, Master Boyster, I bar you: let us
work upon the winners. Gramercy, cinques! Nay, though I owe you no
quarrel, yet you must give me leave to draw.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Haringfield.</span></p>
<p class="i1">I had rather you should draw your sword</p>
<p class="i1">Than draw my money thus.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Chartley.</span></p>
<p class="d1">Again, sweet dice. Nay, I bar swearing: gentlemen, let’s play
patiently. Well, this at the candlestick, so&mdash; [<i>He throws out</i>.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Boyster.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Now, dice, at all. Todo, quoth the Spaniard.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sencer.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Here’s precious luck.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Boyster.</span></p>
<p class="d1">Why, <i>via</i>! I think ’tis quicksilver; it goes and comes so fast:
there’s life in this.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Haringfield.</span></p>
<p class="i1">He passes all with treys.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Chartley.</span></p>
<p class="d1">With treys, how say by that? Oh, he’s old dog at bowls and treys!</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sencer.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Lend me some money: be my half one cast.</p>
<p class="i1">I’ll once out-brave this gamester with a throw.</p>
<p class="i1">So, now the dice are mine, wilt be my half?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Haringfield.</span></p>
<p class="i1">I will.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sencer.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Then once I’ll play the frank gamester.</p>
<p class="i1">Let me but see how much you both can make,</p>
<p class="i1">And I’ll cast at all, all, every cross.<a href="#fn4.03b" id="fn4.03a">[3]</a></p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Chartley.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Now, bless us all, what will you every cross?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sencer.</span></p>
<p class="i1">I will not leave myself one cross to bless me.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Boyster.</span></p>
<p class="i1">I set.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Chartley.</span></p>
<p class="i1">And so do I.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sencer.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Why, then, at all. How! [<i>He flings out</i>.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Chartley.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Nay, swear not; let’s play patiently.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sencer.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Damned dice! did ever gamester see the like?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Boyster.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Never, never.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sencer.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Was ever known such casting?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Chartley.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Drunk nor sober, I ne’er saw a man cast worse.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sencer.</span></p>
<p class="d1">I’ll prove this hat of mine an helmet. Which of you here dares say
the contrary?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Chartley.</span></p>
<p class="d1">As fair an helmet as any man in Europe needs to wear.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sencer.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Chartley, thy hat is black.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Chartley.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Upon better recollection, ’tis so indeed.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sencer.</span></p>
<p class="i1">I say ’tis made of wool.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Chartley.</span></p>
<p class="i1">True, my losing had took away my senses,</p>
<p class="i1">Both of seeing and feeling; but better luck</p>
<p class="i1">Hath brought them to their right temper.</p>
<p class="i1">But come&mdash;a pox of dice! ’tis time to give over.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sencer.</span></p>
<p class="i1">All times are times for winners to give over,</p>
<p class="i1">But not for them that lose. I’ll play till midnight,</p>
<p class="i1">But I will change my luck.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Haringfield.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Come, come, you shall not.</p>
<p class="i1">Give over; tush, give over; do, I pray,</p>
<p class="i1">And choose the fortune of some other hour:</p>
<p class="i1">Let’s not, like debauched fellows, play our clothes,</p>
<p class="i1">Belts, rapiers, nor our needful ornaments:</p>
<p class="i1">’Tis childish, not becoming gentlemen.</p>
<p class="i1">Play was at first ordained to pass the time;</p>
<p class="i1">And, sir, you but abuse the use of play</p>
<p class="i1">To employ it otherwise.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sencer.</span></p>
<p class="i1">You may persuade me.</p>
<p class="i1">For once I’ll leave a loser.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Chartley.</span></p>
<p class="d1">Then come, put on your helmet; let’s leave this abominable game,
and find out some better exercise. I cannot endure this chafing when
men lose.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sencer.</span></p>
<p class="d1">And there’s not a more testy waspish companion than thyself when
thou art a loser, and yet thou must be vexing others with “Play
patiently, gentlemen, and let’s have no swearing.”</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Chartley.</span></p>
<p class="d1">A sign that I can give good counsel better than take it: but say,
where be the prettiest wenches, my hearts?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sencer.</span></p>
<p class="d1">Well remembered; this puts me in mind of an appointment I had with a
gentlewoman of some respect.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Chartley.</span></p>
<p class="d1">I have you, sir, I have you; but I think you will never have her:
’tis Gratiana, the knight’s daughter in Gracious Street.<a href="#fn4.04b" id="fn4.04a">[4]</a>
Have I touched you?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sencer.</span></p>
<p class="d1">You have come somewhat near me, but touched me not. Master
Haringfield, will you bear me company thither? Have you seen the
gentlewoman, Master Chartley?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Chartley.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Never, sir.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sencer.</span></p>
<p class="i1">How have you heard of her?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Chartley.</span></p>
<p class="d1">That she hath as other women have; that she goes for a maid, as
others do, &amp;c.<a href="#fn4.05b" id="fn4.05a">[5]</a></p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sencer.</span></p>
<p class="d1">I can assure you she is a proper gentlewoman.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Chartley.</span></p>
<p class="d1">Then, if she have you, she is like to have a proper gentleman.</p>

<p class="d1">No. I am in love; my head is full of proclamations. There is a thing

enter as far as I with my sharp. No, my true Trojan, no: there is a
fair, sweet, modest rogue, her name is Luce; with this dandiprat,
this pretty little ape’s face, is yon blunt fellow in love; and no
marvel, for she hath a brow bewitching, eyes ravishing, and a tongue
enchanting; and, indeed, she hath no fault in the world but one, and
that is, she is honest; and were it not for that, she were the only
sweet rogue in Christendom. As I live, I love her extremely, and to
enjoy her would give anything; but the fool stands in her own light,
and will do nothing without marriage. But what should I do marrying?
I can better endure gyves than bands of matrimony. But in this
meditation, I am glad I have won my money again. Nay, and she may be
glad of it too; for the girl is but poor, and in my pocket I have
laid up a stock for her,&mdash;’tis put to use already. And if I meet
not with a dice-house or an ordinary by the way, no question but I
may increase it to a sum. Well, I’ll unto the Exchange to buy her
some pretty novelty: that done, I’ll visit my little rascal, and
solicit instantly. [<i>Exit</i>.</p>

so soft a body should have so hard a soul? Nay, now I know my
penance; you will be angry, and school me for tempting your modesty:
a fig for this modesty! it hinders many a good man from many a good
turn, and that’s all the good it doth. If thou but knew’st, Luce,
how I love thee, thou wouldst be far more tractable. Nay, I bar
chiding when you speak; I’ll stop thy lips if thou dost but offer an

being once in, there’s no finding the way out. Well, I love this

hungry, canst thou stay a month from meat? Nay, if I see my diet
before me, I love to fall to when I have a stomach. Here, buy thee a
new smock; let’s have a new bed too, and look it be strong; there’s
a box of rings and jewels, lay them up. Ha, sirrah! methinks the
very name of wedlock hath brought me to a night-cap already, and I
am grown civil on the sudden. There’s more money for dishes,
platters, ladles, candlesticks, &amp;c., as I shall find them set down

myself, to say, “I take thee, Luce;” thou to say, “I, Luce, take
thee, Robin;” the vicar to put us together; and you, father, to play
the clerk, and cry “Amen.”</p>

<p class="i1">Your reason for that?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Young Chartley.</span></p>
<p class="d1">I would not for a world it should be known to my friends, or come to
my father’s ear. It may be ten thousand pounds out of my way. For
the present, therefore, this is my conceit:<a href="#fn4.09b" id="fn4.09a">[9]</a> let us be
married privately, and Luce shall live like a maid still, and bear
the name. ’Tis nothing, Luce: it is a common thing in this age to
go for a maid, and be none. I’ll frequent the house secretly. Fear
not, girl; though I revel abroad o’ days, I’ll be with thee to
bring<a href="#fn4.10b" id="fn4.10a">[10]</a> o’ nights, my little whiting-mop.<a href="#fn4.11b" id="fn4.11a">[11]</a></p>

<p class="d1">Scandal! what scandal? Why, to stop the mouth of all scandal, after
some few days do I appear in my likeness, married man and honest
housekeeper, and then what becomes of your scandal? Come, send for
Master Vicar; and what we do, let’s do suddenly.</p>

<p class="d1">The same, but I hold her to be of no such condition. I will anon
make a step thither, and punctually acquaint her with all our
proceedings: she is never without a Sir John<a href="#fn4.12b" id="fn4.12a">[12]</a> at her elbow,
ready for such a stratagem.</p>

thus far, and can light of no better news to entertain me? Oh, this
wild-headed, wicked Chartley, whom nothing will tame! To this
gallant was I, poor gentlewoman, betrothed, and the marriage day
appointed; but he, out of a fantastic and giddy humour, before the
time prefixed, posts up to London. After him come I thus habited,
and you see my welcome&mdash;to be an ear-witness of his second
contracting. Modesty would not suffer me to discover myself,
otherwise I should have gone near to have marred the match. I heard
them talk of Hogsdon, and a wise-woman, where these aims shall be
brought to action. I’ll see if I can insinuate myself into her
service; that’s my next project: and now good luck of my side!

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Taber.</span></p>

I young Master Sencer; now there you come, and here I meet you; he
comes in this manner, and puts off his hat in this fashion.</p>

<p class="i1">Crave conference with my father. Here he is:</p>
<p class="i1">Now, gallants, you may freely speak your minds.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sencer.</span></p>
<p class="d1">Save you, sir! my name is Sencer; I am a Northamptonshire gentleman,
born to a thousand pound land by the year: I love your daughter, and
I am come to crave your good-will.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sir Harry.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Have you my daughter’s, that you covet mine?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sencer.</span></p>
<p class="i1">No, sir, but I hope in time I shall have.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sir Harry.</span></p>
<p class="i1">So hope not I, sir. Sir, my daughter’s young,</p>
<p class="i1">And you a gentleman unknown. Sencer! ha, Sencer?</p>
<p class="i1">Oh, sir, your name I now remember well;</p>
<p class="i1">’Tis ranked ’mongst unthrifts, dicers, swaggerers, and drunkards:</p>
<p class="i1">Were not you brought before me, some month since,</p>
<p class="i1">For beating of the watch? by the same token,</p>
<p class="i1">I sent you to the Counter.<a href="#fn4.21b" id="fn4.21a">[21]</a></p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sencer.</span></p>
<p class="d1">I confess myself to have been in that action, but note the cause,
sir: you could not have pleasured me so much, in giving me a piece
of gold, as at the same time to help me to that Counter.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sir Harry.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Why, sir, what cause had you to beat the watch,</p>
<p class="i1">And raise a midnight tumult in the streets?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sencer.</span></p>
<p class="d1">Nay, but hear me, sweet Sir Harry. Being somewhat late at supper at
the Mitre, the doors were shut at my lodging; I knocked at three or
four places more; all were a-bed, and fast; inns, taverns, none
would give me entertainment. Now, would you have had me despaired,
and lain in the streets? No, I bethought me of a trick worth two of
that, and presently devised, having at that time a charge of money
about me, to be lodged, and safely too.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sir Harry.</span></p>
<p class="i1">As how, I pray you?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sencer.</span></p>
<p class="d1">Marry, thus: I had knocked my heels against the ground a good while,
knew not where to have a bed for love or money. Now, what did I,
but, spying the watch, went and hit the constable a good souse on
the ear, who provided me of a lodging presently? and the next day,
being brought before your worship, I was then sent thither back
again, where I lay three or four days without control.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Sir Harry.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Oh, you’re a gallant! Is that gentleman</p>
<p class="i1">A suitor too?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Haringfield.</span></p>
<p class="i1">I am a suitor in my friend’s behalf,</p>
<p class="i1">No otherwise. I can assure you, sir,</p>
<p class="i1">He is a gentleman descended well,</p>
<p class="i1">Derived from a good house, well qualified,</p>

<p class="d1">No; if you can get his consent to marry him, shall it displease me?</p>

</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wise-woman.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Jack, thou art my boy.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">2nd Luce.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Mistress!</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wise-woman.</span></p>
<p class="d1">I’ll be a mother to thee, no mistress. Come, lad, I must have thee
sworn to the orders of my house, and the secrets thereof.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">2nd Luce.</span></p>
<p class="d1">As I am an honest lad, I am yours to command. But, mistress, what
mean all these women’s pictures, hanged here in your
withdrawing-room?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wise-woman.</span></p>
<p class="d1">I’ll tell thee, boy&mdash;marry, thou must be secret. When any citizens
or young gentlemen come hither, under a colour to know their
fortunes, they look upon these pictures, and which of them they best
like, she is ready with a wet finger.<a href="#fn4.27b" id="fn4.27a">[27]</a> Here they have all the
furniture belonging to a private-chamber,&mdash;bed, bed-fellow, and all.
But mum! thou knowest my meaning, Jack.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">2nd Luce.</span></p>
<p class="d1">But I see, coming and going, maids, or such as go for maids, some of
them as if they were ready to lie down, sometimes two or three
delivered in one night; then suddenly leave their brats behind them,
and convey themselves into the city again:&mdash;what becomes of their
children?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wise-woman.</span></p>
<p class="d1">Those be kitchen-maids, and chamber-maids, and sometimes good
men’s daughters, who, having catched a clap,<a href="#fn4.28b" id="fn4.28a">[28]</a> and growing
near their time, get leave to see their friends in the country, for
a week or so: then hither they come, and for a matter of money here
they are delivered. I have a midwife or two belonging to the house,
and one Sir Boniface, a deacon, that makes a shift to christen the
infants; we have poor, honest, and secret neighbours, that stand for
common gossips.<a href="#fn4.29b" id="fn4.29a">[29]</a> But dost not thou know this?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">2nd Luce.</span></p>
<p class="d1">Yes, now I do; but what after becomes of the poor infants?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wise-woman.</span></p>
<p class="d1">Why, in the night we send them abroad, and lay one at this man’s
door, and another at that, such as are able to keep them; and what
after becomes of them, we inquire not. And this is another string to
my bow.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">2nd Luce.</span></p>
<p class="i1">[<i>Aside</i>.] Most strange, that woman’s brain should apprehend</p>
<p class="i1">Such lawless, indirect, and horrid means</p>

<p class="i1">Women and men are free of, which they never</p>
<p class="i1">Had charter for!</p>
<p class="d1">But, mistress, are you so cunning as you make yourself? you can
neither write nor read: what do you with those books you so often
turn over?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wise-woman.</span></p>
<p class="d1">Why, tell<a href="#fn4.30b" id="fn4.30a">[30]</a> the leaves; for to be ignorant, and seem ignorant,
what greater folly!</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">2nd Luce.</span></p>
<p class="d1">[<i>Aside</i>.] Believe me, this is a cunning woman; neither hath she her
name for nothing, who out of her ignorance can fool so many that
think themselves wise.&mdash;But wherefore have you built this little
closet close to the door, where sitting, you may hear every word
spoken by all such as ask for you?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wise-woman.</span></p>
<p class="d1">True, and therefore I built it. If any knock, you must to the door
and question them, to find what they come about,&mdash;if to this
purpose, or to that. Now, they ignorantly telling thee their errand,
which I, sitting in my closet, overhear, presently come forth, and
tell them the cause of their coming, with every word that hath
passed betwixt you in private; which they admiring, and thinking it
to be miraculous, by their report I become thus famous.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">2nd Luce.</span></p>
<p class="d1">This is no trade, but a mystery; and, were I a wise-woman, as indeed
I am but a foolish boy, I need not live by your service. But,
mistress, we lose ourselves in this discourse: is not this the
morning in which I should be married?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Wise-woman.</span></p>
<p class="d1">Now, how had I forgot myself! Mistress Luce promised to be with me
half an hour ago, but masked and disguised, and so shalt thou be
too: here’s a black veil to hide thy face against the rest come.</p>

I’ll disturb them by some sudden outcry, and that too before they
have leisure to unmask, and make known themselves one to another;
for, if the deceit were known, I should fall into the danger of that
young mad rascal. And now this double apprehension of the lord and
the lady shall fetch me off from all. I know it is Sir Boniface’s
custom to make short work, and hath dispatched by this. And now,

he’ll make a notable wag, I’ll warrant him. All the jest will be, if
Boyster should meet with him in Luce’s habit, which he hath now on,
he would think himself merely gulled and cheated; and should
Chartley meet with Luce as she is now robed, he would be confident
he had married her. Let me see how many trades have I to live by:
first, I am a wise-woman, and a fortune-teller, and under that I
deal in physic and fore-speaking, in palmistry, and recovering of
things lost; next, I undertake to cure mad folks; then I keep

for a need, you see I can play the match-maker.</p>

<p class="d1">Gratiana! oft have I heard of her, but saw her not till now: ’tis
a pretty wench, a very pretty wench,&mdash;nay, a very, very, very pretty
wench. But what a rogue am I, of a married man&mdash;nay, that have not
been married this six hours, and to have my shittle-wits run a
wool-gathering already! What would poor Luce say if she should hear
of this? I may very well call her poor Luce, for I cannot presume of
five pounds to her portion. What a coxcomb was I, being a gentleman,
and well derived, to match into so beggarly a kindred! What needed I
to have grafted in the stock of such a choke-pear, and such a goodly
popering<a href="#fn4.38b" id="fn4.38a">[38]</a> as this to escape me! Escape me, said I? if she do,
she shall do it narrowly. But I am married already, and therefore it
is not possible, unless I should make away my wife, to compass her.
Married! why, who knows it? I’ll outface the priest, and then there
is none but she and her father, and their evidence is not good in
law; and if they put me in suit, the best is, they are poor, and
cannot follow it. Ay, marry, sir, a man may have some credit by such
a wife as this. I could like this marriage well, if a man might
change away his wife, still as he is a-weary of her, and
cope<a href="#fn4.39b" id="fn4.39a">[39]</a> her away like a bad commodity; if every new moon a man
might have a new wife, that’s every year a dozen. But this “Till
death us do part” is tedious. I will go a-wooing to her, I will;
but how shall I do for jewels and tokens? Luce hath mine in her
custody, money and all. Tush, I’ll juggle them from her well
enough. See, here she comes.</p>

THE RAPE OF LUCRECE.
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">An</span> edition of <i>The Rape of Lucrece</i> was published in 1608; two other
editions followed in 1609, and others again in 1630 and 1638. It was
acted at the Red Bull in Clerkenwell. In the old copies neither the
acts nor the scenes, excepting in the case of the senate scenes, are
marked; in the present reprint the divisions are given, it is hoped,
with approximate correctness.
</p>


<h3>
To the <span class="sc">Reader</span>.
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">It</span> hath been no custom in me of all other men (courteous readers) to
commit my plays to the press; the reason though some may attribute to
my own insufficiency, I had rather subscribe, in that, to their severe
censure, than by seeking to avoid the imputation of weakness, to incur
greater suspicion of honesty: for, though some have used a double sale
of their labours, first to the stage, and after to the press, for my
own part I here proclaim myself ever faithful in the first, and never
guilty of the last. Yet since some of my plays have (unknown to me,
and without any of my direction) accidentally come into the printer’s
hands, and therefore so corrupt and mangled (copied only by the ear)
that I have been as unable to know them as ashamed to challenge them,
this therefore I was the willinger to furnish out in his native habit:
first being by consent; next because the rest have been so wronged,
in being published in such savage and ragged ornaments. Accept it,
courteous gentlemen, and prove as favourable readers as we have found
you gracious auditors.

<p class="i1">Let me know all the news.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Clown.</span></p>
<p class="d1">The news at court is, that a small leg and a silk stocking is in the
fashion for your lord, and the water that God Mercury makes<a href="#fn5.21b" id="fn5.21a">[21]</a>
is in request with your lady. The heaviness of the king’s wine
makes many a light head, and the emptiness of his dishes many full
bellies; eating and drinking was never more in use; you shall find
the baddest legs in boots, and the worst faces in masks. They keep
their old stomachs still: the king’s good cook hath the most
wrong; for that which was wont to be private only to him is now
usurped among all the other officers; for now every man in his
place, to the prejudice of the master cook, makes bold to lick his
own fingers.</p>

<p class="i1">The news in the camp?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Clown.</span></p>

being no camp at all, how can there be any tidings from it?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Clown.</span></p>

traffic dear, for you have many that are broke; the poorest man that
is may take up what he will, so he will be but bound&mdash;to a post till
he pay the debt. There was one courtier lay with twelve men’s wives
in the suburbs, and pressing farther to make one more cuckold within
the walls, and being taken with the manner,<a href="#fn5.22b" id="fn5.22a">[22]</a> had nothing to
say for himself but this&mdash;he that made twelve made thirteen.</p>

receipt. And is it not strange, my lord, that so many men love ale
that know not what ale is?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Collatine.</span></p>
<p class="i1">Why, what is ale?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Clown.</span></p>
<p class="d1">Why, ale is a kind of juice made of the precious grain called malt;
and what is malt? Malt’s M A L T; and what is M A L T? M much, A
ale, L little, T thrift; that is, much ale, little thrift.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="cn">Clown.</span></p>

concerns her nearly, and I was sent in all haste to entreat your

<p class="d1">Ay, marry, sir, the way into her were a way worth following, and
that’s the reason that so many serving-men that are familiar with
their mistresses have lost the name of servitors, and are now called
their masters’ followers. Rest you merry!</p>

been arch-treason, in Tarquin was honour; what in Brutus had been
usurpation, in Tarquin was lawful succession; and for Tullia, though
it be parricide for a child to kill her father, in Tullia it was
charity by death to rid him of all his calamities. Phœbus himself
said she was a good child&mdash;and shall not I say as he says?&mdash;to tread
upon her father’s skull,</p>

<p class="i1">After his death deny him the due claim</p>

pinking, never nodded at her&mdash;no, not so much as when I was asleep;
never asked her the question so much as what’s her name: if you
can bring any man, woman, or child, that can say so much behind my
back as “For he did but kiss her, for I did but kiss her, and so
let her go,” let my Lord Collatine, instead of plucking my coat,
pluck my skin over my ears and turn me away naked, that wheresoever
I shall come I may be held a raw serving-man hereafter.</p>

jewel, would I might die like a beggar! If ever I were so far read
in my grammar as to know what an interjection is, or a conjunction
copulative, would I might never have good of my <i>qui quæ quod</i>!
Why, do you think, madam, I have no more care of myself, being but a
stripling, than to go to it at these years? Flesh and blood cannot
endure it; I shall even spoil one of the best faces in Rome with
crying at your unkindness.</p>

<a href="#i.01a" id="i.01b">[1]</a>
“So compared by the Fathers,” Heywood explains in the margin.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#i.02a" id="i.02b">[2]</a>
Prefixed to his <i>Apology for Actors</i> (1612).
</p>

<p>
<a href="#i.03a" id="i.03b">[3]</a>
Until recently, Heywood’s plays were only accessible piecemeal and
in parts. Dodsley’s collection contained two; Dilke’s contained
three, and Baldwyn’s two. Between 1842 and 1851, the Old Shakespeare
Society produced altogether twelve; while Mr. Halliwell in 1853
printed the <i>Lancashire Witches</i> separately. At last, in 1874 Mr.
John Pearson issued a complete edition in six volumes. Since that
date another play in MS. by Heywood, <i>The Captives</i>, was discovered
and printed by Mr. A. H. Bullen in the last volume of his <i>Old
Plays</i> (1885).
</p>

<p>
<a href="#i.04a" id="i.04b">[4]</a>
With this main-plot Heywood has interwoven a subordinate and
independent story. To dwell upon this under-plot would be
superfluous. Yet I may point out that it is borrowed from an Italian
Novella by Illicini, the incidents of which Heywood carefully
transferred to English scenes. In like manner <i>The Captive</i>,
consists of a main-plot borrowed from the <i>Mostellaria</i> of Plautus
and an under-plot adapted from a novella of the Neapolitan,
<i>Masuccio</i>. See my <i>Shakspere’s Predecessors</i> (p. 462), and a letter
written by me to the <i>Academy</i> (Dec. 12, 1885).

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
